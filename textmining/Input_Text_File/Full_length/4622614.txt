Production of alpha2,6-sialylated IgG1 in CHO cells.
The presence of alpha2,6-sialic acids on the Fc N-glycan provides anti-inflammatory properties to the IgGs through a mechanism that remains unclear. Fc-sialylated IgGs are rare in humans as well as in industrial host cell lines such as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Facilitated access to well-characterized alpha2,6-sialylated IgGs would help elucidate the mechanism of this intriguing IgG's effector function. This study presents a method for the efficient Fc glycan alpha2,6-sialylation of a wild-type and a F243A IgG1 mutant by transient co-expression with the human alpha2,6-sialyltransferase 1 (ST6) and beta1,4-galactosyltransferase 1 (GT) in CHO cells. Overexpression of ST6 alone only had a moderate effect on the glycoprofiles, whereas GT alone greatly enhanced Fc-galactosylation, but not sialylation. Overexpression of both GT and ST6 was necessary to obtain a glycoprofile dominated by alpha2,6-sialylated glycans in both antibodies. The wild-type was composed of the G2FS(6)1 glycan (38%) with remaining unsialylated glycans, while the mutant glycoprofile was essentially composed of G2FS(6)1 (25%), G2FS(3,6)2 (16%) and G2FS(6,6)2 (37%). The alpha2,6-linked sialic acids represented over 85% of all sialic acids in both antibodies. We discuss how the limited sialylation level in the wild-type IgG1 expressed alone or with GT results from the glycan interaction with Fc's amino acid residues or from intrinsic galactosyl- and sialyl-transferases substrate specificities.
Results.
Production of sialylated antibodies.
TZM was expressed by co-transfection of 2 plasmids, one coding for the HC and the other coding for the light chain (LC). A HC:LC ratio of 2:3 (w:w) was used to ensure optimal expression of the mAb in CHO-3E7 cells as determined in a previous work. The human membrane-associated beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 1 (GT) and beta-galactoside alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase 1 (ST6) were co-expressed with the mAbs to enhance galactosylation or alpha2,6-sialylation of the Fc. The quantity of GT-encoding plasmid necessary to achieve maximal galactosylation of the Fc was first assessed. Between 0.5% to 10% (w:w) of GT plasmid was incorporated into the DNA mix, for a final DNA concentration of 1 mug per mL of culture to be transfected. The extent of Fc glycan galactosylation was determined by lectin-blot using the Erythrina cristagalli lectin (ECL) that specifically detects terminal galactoses. The blot showed that 2% of GT encoding plasmid was sufficient to allow maximal galactosylation of the HC (Fig. 2A). The assay was repeated with a 98:2 (w:w) TZM:GT plasmid ratio and various amounts of the ST6 encoding plasmid. The Sambucus nigra lectin (SNA) was used to evaluate alpha2,6-sialylation. As previously reported, 20% of ST6 plasmid in the transfection mix was optimal for HC sialylation (Fig. 2B). The DNA mix composition selected was thus 2% of GT plasmid and 20% of ST6 plasmid (Fig. 2A-B). Next, we assessed the optimal harvest time that produced the highest alpha2,6-sialylation level of the Fc. HC alpha2,6-sialylation was monitored by SNA-blot from 2 d post-transfection (dpt) until day 9 post-transfection where cell viability dropped to ~40%. The cultures were shifted from 37 C to 32 C at 1 dpt to delay cell death and increase production yields. The harvest time was set at 4 dpt to get an optimal Fc sialylation while allowing for acceptable TZM yields of ~15-20 mg/L after protein-A purification (Fig. 2C).
Antibody characterization.
These optimal conditions were scaled up to 500 mL cultures to produce milligrams of TZM expressed alone or co-expressed with GT, ST6 or both (designated GT, ST6 or GTST6, respectively). The TZM containing the F243A substitution (TZMm) was also produced under the same conditions. All antibodies were obtained at yields of ~15-20 mg/L. Following protein-A purification, the sialylation levels were first evaluated by cIEF and lectin-blotting. Figure 3A shows that TZM IEF profile was defined by a main charge variant flanked by very low amounts of 2 basic variants and 2 acidic variants. A non-glycosylated version of TZM, the N297Q mutant, exhibited the same profile, showing that the basic and acidic variants were not due to Fc glycan. In contrast, TZMm exhibited high levels of acidic variants. Its desialylation by an alpha2,3SA-specific sialidase (sialidase S) resulted in the complete loss of these acidic variants, confirming that appearance of these acidic variants on cIEF is the consequence of sialylation. Interestingly, TZMGT and TZMST6 showed the same cIEF profile as TZM, whereas TZMGTST6 and the 4 TZMm samples (+/- GT and/or ST6) had patterns differing in number, pI and intensity of acidic variants (Fig. 3B panel 1). SNA-blotting confirmed the presence of alpha2,6SA in TZMGTST6, TZMmST6 and TZMmGTST6, but no signal was detected in TZMST6, supporting IEF results (Fig. 3B panel 2). Maackia amurensis lectin II (MALII)-blotting was then used to detect endogenous CHO alpha2,3-sialylation, which was only detectable in the 4 TZMm samples. The strongest signal was obtained when TZMm was expressed alone (Fig. 3B panel 3), declined when GT or ST6 were co-expressed, and became almost undetectable in the presence of both GT and ST6. Finally, the presence of terminal galactose residues was assessed using the Erythrina cristagalli lectin (Fig. 3B panel 4). No or only barely detectable ECL signal was detected when TZM or TZMm were expressed alone or co-expressed with ST6. However, a strong signal appeared when both mAbs were co-expressed with GT, indicating efficient galactosylation. The ECL signal was significantly reduced when TZM was co-expressed with GT and ST6 while it completely disappeared in the case of TZMmGTST6, indicating efficient sialylation by ST6.
Glycan analyses by mass spectrometry.
To confirm these observations and describe further the effect of the F243A mutation and co-expression of glycosyltransferases on TZM glycoprofiles, the antibodies were submitted to LC-ESI-MS analysis. They were first digested by the immunoglobulin-degrading enzyme from Streptococcus pyogenes (IdeS), which cleaves the antibody into a F(ab')2 fragment and 2 Fc/2 (CH2-CH3) glycosylated polypeptides. The molecular weight profiles obtained for the Fc/2 glycopeptides by LC-ESI-MS are shown in Figure 4 and their relative intensities are presented in Table 1. For each mAb, the relative peak intensities were used to calculate the relative number of branches terminated by a given monosaccharide residue among the complex glycans (Table 2). Non-glycosylated Fc/2 peptides were not detected in any of the 8 conditions, confirming the full occupancy of the N297 glycosylation site in all antibodies.
TZM showed the classical glycoprofile of CHO-produced IgG1, i.e., a large majority of fucosylated non-galactosylated glycans (G0F, 54.4 +- 1.9%), followed by monogalactosylated glycans (G1F, 31.4 +- 2.1%) and small amounts of fully galactosylated glycans (G2F, 5.1 +- 0.1%) (Fig. 4A). As suggested by the cIEF and lectin-blot results, ST6 expression had negligible effect on TZM glycan (Fig. 4B); only small amounts of the mono-sialylated species G1FS1 and G2FS1 (5.8 +- 0.7% and 2.7 +- 0.7%, respectively) were obtained. To estimate the sialylation efficiency independently of the composition of the glycan pool, we expressed the sialylation level in relative number of antennae carrying a sialic acid among the complex glycan branches, i.e., excluding high-mannose and hybrid glycan branches (see the Materials and Methods Section for the formula employed). We found that only 4.8 +- 0.1% of the complex antennae were terminated by a sialic acid in TZMST6 (Table 2). However, expression of GT dramatically modified TZM glycoprofile as seen on the m/z profile (Fig. 4C); G2F became the predominant glycan (44.8 +- 2.1%), and the percentage of complex antennae terminated by a galactose increased from 22.7 +- 0.4% in TZM to 66.4 +- 1.2% in TZMGT (Table 2). Although it could not be seen by cIEF and lectin-blot analyses, the presence of terminal sialic acid was detected at low level (4.6 +- 0.6% of glycans), despite the abundance of terminal galactose residues available for the CHO endogenous ST3 enzyme. Upon co-expression of both GT and ST6, the amount of G2F significantly decreased compared to TZMGT (20.9 +- 2.9% vs 44.8 +- 2.1%) while G2FS1 increased to 32.0 +- 1.0%, becoming the major glycan found in TZMGTST6 sample (Fig. 4D). However, only a little amount of G2FS2 was detected (6.6 +- 0.8%). In contrast with the TZM produced in the other 3 conditions, where less than 5% of the complex glycan branches were sialylated, up to 25.4 +- 0.2% of the complex glycan branches were terminated by a sialic acid in TZMGTST6 (Table 2). These results confirmed that both GT and ST6 were necessary to raise sialylation of the wild-type TZM to high levels as previously suggested by the cIEF analysis.
Impact of the F243A mutation.
The F243A mutation resulted in a sharp increase in the glycan heterogeneity compared to the wild-type TZM (Fig. 4E). This was a direct consequence of the appearance of the sialylated glycans G1FS1, G2FS1 and G2FS2, representing ~14%, 17% and 20%, respectively, of the glycan species. This increased sialylation was enabled by a high level of galactosylation compared to the wild-type antibody; the proportion of complex glycan arms carrying a galactose residue, either terminal or capped with a SA, increased from 23.2 +- 0.3% in TZM up to 73.9 +- 2.4% in TZMm (Table 2). Similarly to TZMST6, the co-expression of the F243A mutant with ST6 resulted in a moderate 11.5% increase in the relative number of complex arms terminated by a SA (Fig. 4F, Table 2), while its co-expression with human GT resulted in >95% of the complex glycan branches carrying a galactose (Table 2). Interestingly, and as observed with TZMGT, G2F was the dominant species (41.0 +- 0.5%) in TZMmGT (Fig. 4G). However, this increased galactosylation did not lead to a higher sialylation; the sialylation level was even lower in TZMmGT than in TZMm (40% and 55% of sialylated glycans, respectively). Finally, the TZMmGTST6 glycans were mostly sialylated (Fig. 4H and Table 1); G2FS2 and G2FS1 were the predominant glycans (50.4 +- 4.4% and 29.1 +- 4.0%, respectively), meaning that over 75% of the complex glycan branches were terminated by a sialic acid (Table 2). Moreover, 78% of the galactoses were sialylated compared to only 34% in TZMGTST6 (Table 2), suggesting that the F243A mutation greatly improves ST6-mediated sialylation.
Determination of sialic acid linkage type.
Considering the extremely low level of alpha2,3-sialylation in TZMGT, we hypothesized that the sialic acids in TZMGTST6 glycans were mostly - if not only - of the alpha2,6 type, whereas in the mutants TZMmST6 and TZMmGTST6, the sialylated glycans could contain a mixture of alpha2,3- and alpha2,6-linked SA. The SA linkage types in the glycans were assessed by cIEF and HILIC analysis after digestion with the alpha2,3SA-specific sialidase S from Streptococcus pneumoniae or the non-specific sialidase A from Arthrobacter ureafaciens.
TZMGTST6.
Specific alpha2,3SA digestion with Sialidase S had no effect on the cIEF profile of TZMGTST6 (Fig. 5A), in agreement with the absence of signal on the MALII-blot (see Fig. 3B panel 3). This was also confirmed by HILIC analysis of sialidase S treatment of PNGaseF released Fc-glycans (Fig. 5B). The G0F, G1F, G2F and G2FS1 glycans were detected in increasing amounts, in accordance with LC-ESI-MS analyses. The correlation between the glycans relative abundances as detected by MS and HILIC analyses of TZMGTST6 was very good (Pearson correlation coefficient P = 0.95). G2FS1 mainly appeared (~95%) as an alpha2,6-sialylated isomer G2FS(6)1 (37.6 +- 4.0%) eluting at a retention time (RT) of 41.2 min (Table 3). It is noteworthy that G2FS(6)1 eluted on some occasions at a higher RT corresponding to the G2FS(3,3)2 glycan, but each time the peak was not sensitive to sialidase S digestion (data not shown). The peak at RT = 42.4 min was attributed to the disialylated glycan G2FS(3,6)2 (4.1 +- 1.1%), although a small peak remaining after sialidase S treatment suggested the presence of a co-eluting compound (Fig. 5B, C & D). G2FS(6,6)2 was also detected at a low level. It was found that 88% of the sialic acids in TZMGTST6 glycans were of alpha2,6 type (Table 3 and Fig. 6).
TZMmST6.
The alpha2,3SA-specific desialylation of TZMmST6 resulted in a drastic decrease in the abundance of the most acidic bands of the cIEF profile (Fig. 5A), demonstrating the presence of alpha2,3SA, as supported by MALII-blotting (Fig. 3B, panel 3). However, the HILIC profile obtained for TZMmST6 did not fully agreed with the LC-ESI-MS data (Pearson correlation coefficient P = 0.77) (compare Fig. 5C with Fig. 4F). There were 2 main discrepancies with the LC-ESI-MS profile; first, the glycan G2F (RT = 38.7 min) appeared more abundant in HILIC than in MS (HILIC: 12%; MS: 2%), and second, the G1FS1 glycans (2 isomers at RT = 37.4 and 39.1 min) were less abundant in HILIC than in MS (HILIC: 10%; MS: 17%) (Figs. 4F and 5C, Tables 1 and 3). Nevertheless, the presence of the alpha2,3-sialylated glycans G1FS(3)1, G2FS(3)1 and G2FS(3,6)2, eluting at 37.4 min, 39.9 min and 42.3 min, respectively, was confirmed by sialidase S digestion (Fig. 5C). The alpha2,6-sialylated isomers G1FS(6)1 (RT = 39.1 min), G2FS(6)1 (RT = 41.2 min) and G2FS(6,6)2 (RT = 43.4 min), were also detected, although the peaks appeared altered by the sialidase S treatment (the increased peak intensities of G0F and G1F suggests some non-specific digestion). It was found that G1FS(3)1 was the predominant G1FS1 isoform while G2FS(6)1 was the predominant G2FS1 isoform (Table 3). The G2FS2 glycans were a mixture of G2FS(3,6)2 (18.8 +- 0.9%) and G2FS(6,6)2 (11.7 +- 3.5%) isoforms. Interestingly the G2FS(3,3)2 isoform was not detected (Table 3), suggesting that ST6 is faster than ST3 to sialylate G2FS(3)1. Overall, the predominant SA linkage in TZMmST6 was of the alpha2,6 type (63%), although its predominance over the alpha2,3-linkage type was less pronounced than in TZMGTST6 (Table 3 or Fig. 6).
TZMmGTST6.
The sialidase S treatment resulted in a decreased intensity of the most acidic bands on the cIEF profile (Fig. 5A), suggesting the presence of alpha2,3SA in TZMmGTST6 as predicted by the MALII-blot (Fig. 3B, panel 3). The relative abundances of TZMmGTST6 glycans as determined by HILIC were in very good agreement with those of the corresponding Fc/2 glycopeptides detected by LC-ESI-MS (Pearson correlation coefficient P = 0.99). The chromatogram showed that G2FS(6,6)2 was the major glycan (Fig. 5D), (37 +- 5.8%), followed by G2FS(6)1 (24.6 +- 3.5%) (Table 3). The G2FS2 isoform G2FS(3,6)2 was the third glycan in abundance (15.8 +- 2.0%) (Fig. 5D, Table 2), whereas G2FS(3,3)2 was again not found. The predominance of alpha2,6SA was similar to that found in TZMGTST6 as they represented 85% of all sialic acids present in the G1FS1, G2FS1 and G2FS2 glycans (Table 3 or Fig. 6).
