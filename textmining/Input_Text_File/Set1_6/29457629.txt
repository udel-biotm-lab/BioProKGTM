Antibody glycoengineering strategies in mammalian cells. As a key parameter impacting functional and structural heterogeneity, protein glycosylation is a critical quality attribute for antibody biotherapeutic manufacturing. The glycan patterns on recombinant antibodies, particularly on the conserved fragment crystallizable (Fc) region, can have significant effects on an antibody's functional activities including clearance rate, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and anti-inflammatory activity. In this review, we examined specific glycan attachments (fucosylation, sialylation, galactosylation, high-mannose, and bisecting glycans) and their importance to antibody properties. Next, we summarized the recent and current achievements on controlling antibody glycoforms in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and other mammalian cells through multiple strategies including genetic engineering, protein engineering, media modification, and other emerging technologies. Further, the impact of one carbohydrate modification on other glycan structures is also described. Finally, approaches to generate desirable homogenous glycan profiles on antibodies are also detailed. By applying multiple complementary intracellular and extracellular strategies, biotechnologists are well on their ways to precisely tuning antibody glycoforms emerging from bioreactors in the coming decades.
