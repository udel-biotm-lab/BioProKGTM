Online control of cell culture redox potential prevents antibody interchain disulfide bond reduction. The phenomenon of monoclonal antibody (mAb) interchain disulfide bond reduction during manufacturing processes continues to be a focus of the biotechnology industry due to the potential for loss of product, increased complexity of purification processes, and reduced stability of the drug product. We hypothesized that antibody reduction can be mitigated by controlling the cell culture redox potential and subsequently established a threshold redox potential above which the mAb remained intact and below which there were significant and highly variable amounts of reduced mAb. Using this knowledge, we developed three control schemes to prevent mAb reduction in the bioreactor by controlling the cell culture redox potential via an online redox probe. These control methodologies functioned by increasing the concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO), copper (II) (Cu), or both DO and Cu to maintain the redox potential above the threshold value. Using these methods, we were able to demonstrate successful control of antibody reduction. Importantly, the redox control strategies did not significantly impact the cell growth, viability, mAb production, or product quality attributes including aggregates, C-terminal lysine, high mannose, deamidation, and glycation. Our results demonstrate that controlling the cell culture redox potential is a simple and effective method to prevent mAb reduction.
