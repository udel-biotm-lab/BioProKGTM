Metabolomic and quality data for early and late passages of an antibody-producing industrial CHO cell line. In this article, we provide four data sets for an industrial Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line producing antibodies during a 14-day bioreactor run. This cell line was selected for further evaluation because of its significant titer loss as the cells were passaged over time. Four conditions that differed in cell bank ages were run for this dataset. Specifically, cells were passaged to passage 12, 21, 25, and 37 and then used in this experiment. Once the run commenced the following datasets were gathered: 1). Glycosylation data for each reactor 2). Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) data for the antibodies produced which allowed for the identification of high and low molecular weight species in the samples (N-Glycan and SEC data was taken on day 14 only). 3/4). Metabolites levels measured using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) for all reactors over the time course of days 1, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 14. We also provide a graph of the glutamine levels for cells of different ages as an example of the utility of the data. These metabolomics data provide relative amounts for 36 metabolites (NMR) and 109 metabolites (LC-MS) over the 14-day time course. These data were collected in connection with a co-submitted paper [1].
