Butyrate increases production of human chimeric IgG in CHO-K1 cells whilst maintaining function and glycoform profile. The influence of sodium butyrate on the production and glycosylation of recombinant mouse/human chimeric antibody by transfected CHO-K1 cells was investigated. We selected cells expressing 'wild-type' antibody with a human IgG3 heavy chain and a mutant of this molecule in which Phe 243 is replaced by Ala. These proteins have previously been shown to exhibit very different glycoform profiles with the mutant IgG being comprised of glycoforms having a high galactose and sialic acid content. Cell culture with 0-5 mM butyrate was shown to effect a 2-4-fold increase in antibody production whilst the induction of apoptosis was observed in a dose-dependent manner. The optimal butyrate concentration was observed to be 2 mM. The glycoform profile of each antibody produced in the presence of butyrate was analyzed by HPAEC-PAD and shown to be unchanged, relative to that produced in the absence of butyrate. Biological activity was evaluated by the ability of the antibodies to trigger superoxide generation, through Fc gamma RI, and shown to be independent of production in the presence or absence of butyrate. A similar increase in production was observed for a high antibody-producing cell line when expanded in a hollow fibre bioreactor under low-serum conditions (1%). These results demonstrated that butyrate is of value for increasing the productivity of CHO-K1 for recombinant IgG and does not compromise either glycosylation or biological activity.
