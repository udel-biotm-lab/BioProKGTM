A time-dependent decrease of total sialylation correlating with an increase in galactosylation was observed for mAb2 in both controlled and uncontrolled systems, suggesting either a higher activity of sialidases or an increase in the synthesis of galactosylated glycans during the stationary phase. Contrary effects on cell performance and protein glycosylation were observed for manganese and iron. Despite the variability in qPCR data, a decrease in gene expression with increasing siRNA concentration can be observed throughout the cultures for both fut8 and gmds expression. For cell line 3, a higher cell growth was observed for FCPurch and FCSynt + Mn2+ compared to FCSynt with an increase in maximal VCD of more than 32% and 9% for 10 and 50 mg Fe/L, respectively (Figure 7d), whereas a prolonged viability upon the presence of manganese was also observed for this cell line independently of the tested iron concentration (Figure 7e). Interestingly, TZMGT and TZMST6 showed the same cIEF profile as TZM, whereas TZMGTST6 and the 4 TZMm samples (+/- GT and/or ST6) had patterns differing in number, pI and intensity of acidic variants (Fig. 3B panel 1). Meanwhile, clone A11 showed slightly greater late culture viability than CP19 and CP24, and A11 had a distinctively lower lactate profile than the other cell clones. No statistically significant differences were observed for IVC, viability, titer, or lactate and ammonia production in these experiments (data not shown). Other pathways linked to glycolysis and TCA cycle such as glutamine/glutamate metabolism (which serves as a precursor to N-acetylated NSD intermediates), pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and oxidative phosphorylation showed significant time dynamics in their corresponding gene sets, transcripts, and metabolites (Table 1).
