Monitoring recombinant human interferon-gamma N-glycosylation during perfused fluidized-bed and stirred-tank batch culture of CHO cells. Chinese hamster ovary cells producing recombinant human interferon-gamma were cultivated for 500 h attached to macroporous microcarriers in a perfused, fluidized-bed bioreactor, reaching a maximum cell density in excess of 3 x 10(7) cells (mL microcarrier)-1 at a specific growth rate (mu) of 0.010 h-1. During establishment of the culture, the N-glycosylation of secreted recombinant IFN-gamma was monitored by capillary electrophoresis of intact IFN-gamma proteins and by HPLC analysis of released N-glycans. Rapid analysis of IFN-gamma by micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography resolved the three glycosylation site occupancy variants of recombinant IFN-gamma (two Asn sites occupied, one Asn site occupied and nonglycosylated) in under 10 min per sample; the relative proportions of these variants remained constant during culture. Analysis of IFN-gamma by capillary isoelectric focusing resolved at least 11 differently sialylated glycoforms over a pI range of 3.4 to 6.4, enabling rapid quantitation of this important source of microheterogeneity. During perfusion culture the relative proportion of acidic IFN-gamma proteins increased after 210 h of culture, indicative of an increase in N-glycan sialylation. This was confirmed by cation-exchange HPLC analysis of released, fluorophore-labeled N-glycans, which showed an increase in the proportion of tri- and tetrasialylated N-glycans associated with IFN-gamma during culture, with a concomitant decrease in the proportion of monosialylated and neutral N-glycans. Comparative analyses of IFN-gamma produced by CHO cells in stirred-tank culture showed that N-glycan sialylation was stable until late in culture, when a decline in sialylation coincided with the onset of cell death and lysis. This study demonstrates that different modes of capillary electrophoresis can be employed to rapidly and quantitatively monitor the main sources of glycoprotein variation, and that the culture system and operation may influence the glycosylation of a recombinant glycoprotein.

Ammonium alters N-glycan structures of recombinant TNFR-IgG: degradative versus biosynthetic mechanisms. The effect of ammonium on the glycosylation pattern of the recombinant immunoadhesin tumor necrosis factor-IgG (TNFR-IgG) produced by Chinese hamster ovary cells is elucidated in this study. TNFR-IgG is a chimeric IgG fusion protein bearing one N-linked glycosylation site in the Fc region and three complex-type N-glycans in the TNF-receptor portion of each monomer. The ammonium concentration of batch suspension cultures was adjusted with glutamine and/or NH(4)Cl. The amount of galactose (Gal) and N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA) residues on TNFR-IgG correlated in a dose-dependent manner with the ammonium concentration under which the N-linked oligosaccharides were synthesized. As ammonium increased from 1 to 15 mM, a concomitant decrease of up to 40% was observed in terminal galactosylation and sialylation of the molecule. Cell culture supernatants contained measurable beta-galactosidase and sialidase activity, which increased throughout the culture. The beta-galactosidase, but not the sialidase, level was proportional to the ammonium concentration. No loss of N-glycans was observed in incubation studies using beta-galactosidase and sialidase containing cell culture supernatants, suggesting that the ammonium effect was biosynthetic and not degradative. Several biosynthetic mechanisms were investigated. Ammonium (a weak base) is known to affect the pH of acidic intracellular compartments (e.g., trans-Golgi) as well as intracellular nucleotide sugar pools (increases UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine). Ammonium might also affect the expression rates of beta1, 4-galactosyltransferase (beta1,4-GT) and alpha2,3-sialyltransferase (alpha2,3-ST). To separate these mechanisms, experiments were designed using chloroquine (changes intracellular pH) and glucosamine (increases UDP-GNAc pool [sum of UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc]). The ammonium effect on TNFR-IgG oligosaccharide structures could be mimicked only by chloroquine, another weak base. No differences in N-glycosylation were found in the product synthesized in the presence of glucosamine. No differences in beta1, 4-galactosyltransferase (beta1,4-GT) and alpha2,3-sialyltransferase (alpha2,3-ST) messenger RNA (mRNA) and enzyme levels were observed in cells cultivated in the presence or absence of 13 mM NH(4)Cl. pH titration of endogenous CHO alpha2,3-ST and beta-1,4-GT revealed a sharp optimum at pH 6.5, the reported trans-Golgi pH. Thus, at pH 7.0 to 7.2, a likely trans-Golgi pH range in the presence of 10 to 15 mM ammonium, activities for both enzymes are reduced to 50% to 60%. Consequently, ammonium seems to alter the carbohydrate biosynthesis of TNFR-IgG by a pH-mediated effect on glycosyltransferase activity.

Butyrate increases production of human chimeric IgG in CHO-K1 cells whilst maintaining function and glycoform profile. The influence of sodium butyrate on the production and glycosylation of recombinant mouse/human chimeric antibody by transfected CHO-K1 cells was investigated. We selected cells expressing 'wild-type' antibody with a human IgG3 heavy chain and a mutant of this molecule in which Phe 243 is replaced by Ala. These proteins have previously been shown to exhibit very different glycoform profiles with the mutant IgG being comprised of glycoforms having a high galactose and sialic acid content. Cell culture with 0-5 mM butyrate was shown to effect a 2-4-fold increase in antibody production whilst the induction of apoptosis was observed in a dose-dependent manner. The optimal butyrate concentration was observed to be 2 mM. The glycoform profile of each antibody produced in the presence of butyrate was analyzed by HPAEC-PAD and shown to be unchanged, relative to that produced in the absence of butyrate. Biological activity was evaluated by the ability of the antibodies to trigger superoxide generation, through Fc gamma RI, and shown to be independent of production in the presence or absence of butyrate. A similar increase in production was observed for a high antibody-producing cell line when expanded in a hollow fibre bioreactor under low-serum conditions (1%). These results demonstrated that butyrate is of value for increasing the productivity of CHO-K1 for recombinant IgG and does not compromise either glycosylation or biological activity.

Metabolic control of recombinant protein N-glycan processing in NS0 and CHO cells. Chinese hamster ovary and murine myeloma NS0 cells are currently favored host cell types for the production of therapeutic recombinant proteins. In this study, we compared N-glycan processing in GS-NS0 and GS-CHO cells producing the same model recombinant glycoprotein, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1. By manipulation of intracellular nucleotide-sugar content, we examined the feasibility of implementing metabolic control strategies aimed at reducing the occurrence of murine-specific glycan motifs on NS0-derived recombinant proteins, such as Galalpha1,3Galbeta1,4GlcNAc. Although both CHO and NS0-derived oligosaccharides were predominantly of the standard complex type with variable sialylation, 30% of N-glycan antennae associated with NS0-derived TIMP-1 terminated in alpha1,3-linked galactose residues. Furthermore, NS0 cells conferred a greater proportion of terminal N-glycolylneuraminic (sialic) acid residues as compared with the N-acetylneuraminic acid variant. Inclusion of the nucleotide-sugar precursors, glucosamine (10 mM, plus 2 mM uridine) and N-acetylmannosamine (20 mM), in culture media were shown to significantly increase the intracellular pools of UDP-N-acetylhexosamine and CMP-sialic acid, respectively, in both NS0 and CHO cells. The elevated UDP-N-acetylhexosamine content induced by the glucosamine/uridine treatment was associated with an increase in the antennarity of N-glycans associated with TIMP-1 produced in CHO cells but not N-glycans associated with TIMP-1 from NS0 cells. In addition, elevated UDP-N-acetylhexosamine content was associated with a slight decrease in sialylation in both cell lines. The elevated CMP-sialic acid content induced by N-acetylmannosamine had no effect on the overall level of sialylation of TIMP-1 produced by both CHO and NS0 cells, although the ratio of N-glycolylneuraminic acid:N-acetylneuraminic acid associated with NS0-derived TIMP-1 changed from 1:1 to 1:2. These data suggest that manipulation of nucleotide-sugar metabolism can promote changes in N-glycan processing that are either conserved between NS0 and CHO cells or specific to either NS0 cells or CHO cells.

Erythropoietin production from CHO cells grown by continuous culture in a fluidized-bed bioreactor. A Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line that expresses human erythropoietin (huEPO) was in a 2-L Cytopilot fluidized-bed bioreactor with 400 mL macroporous Cytoline-1 microcarriers and a variable perfusion rate of serum-free and protein-free medium for 48 days. The cell density increased to a maximum of 23 x 10(6) cells/mL, beads on day 27. The EPO concentration increased to 600 U/mL during the early part of the culture period (on day 24) and increased further to 980 U/mL following the addition of a higher concentration of glucose and the addition of sodium butyrate. The EPO concentration was significantly higher (at least 2x than that in a controlled stirred-tank bioreactor, in a spinner flask, or in a stationary T-flask culture. The EPO accumulated to a total production of 28,000 kUnits over the whole culture period. The molecular characteristics of EPO with respect to size and pattern of glycosylation did not change with scale up. The pattern of utilization and production of 18 amino acids was similar in the Cytopilot culture to that in a stationary batch culture in a T-flask. The concentration of ammonia was maintained at a low level (< 2 mM) over the entire culture period. The specific rate of consumption of glucose, as well as the specific rates of production of lactate and ammonia, were constant throughout the culture period indicating a consistent metabolic behavior of the cells in the bioreactor. These results indicate the potential of the Cytopilot bioreactor culture system for the continuous production of a recombinant protein over several weeks.

Effect of shear stress on intrinsic CHO culture state and glycosylation of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator protein. Shear stress in suspension culture was investigated as a possible manipulative parameter for the control of glycosylation of the recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator protein (r-tPA) produced by recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell culture, grown in protein-free media. Resulting fractions of partially glycosylated, Type II, and fully glycosylated, Type I, r-tPA protein were monitored as a direct function of the shear characteristics of the culture environment. The shear-induced response of CHO culture to levels of low shear stress, where exponential growth was not obtained, and to higher levels of shear stress, which resulted in extensive cell death, were examined through manipulation of the bioreactor stirring velocity. Both apparent and intrinsic cell growth, metabolite consumption, byproduct and r-tPA production, and r-tPA glycosylation, from a variable site-occupancy standpoint, were monitored throughout. Kinetic analyses revealed a shear-stress-induced alteration of cellular homeostasis resulting in a nonlinear dependency of metabolic yield coefficients and an intrinsic cell lysis kinetic constant on shear stress. Damaging levels of shear stress were used to investigate the shear dependence of cell death and lysis, as well as the effects on the intrinsic growth rate of the culture. Kinetic models were also developed on the basis of the intrinsic state of the culture and compared to traditional models. Total r-tPA production was maximized under moderate shear conditions, as was the viable CHO cell density of the culture. However, Type II r-tPA production and the fraction of Type II glycoform production ratio was maximized under damaging levels of shear stress. Analyses of biomass production yield coefficients coupled with a plug-flow reactor model of glycan addition in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) were used to propose an overall mechanism of decreased r-tPA protein site-occupancy glycosylation with increasing shear stress. Decreased residence time of r-tPA in the ER as a result of increased protein synthesis related to shear protection mechanisms is proposed to limit contact of site Asn184 with the membrane-bound oligosaccharyltransferase enzyme in the ER.

Recombinant MUC1 mucin with a breast cancer-like O-glycosylation produced in large amounts in Chinese-hamster ovary cells. We have developed an expression system for the production of large quantities of recombinant MUC1 mucin in CHO-K1 (Chinese-hamster ovary K1) cells. The extracellular part of human MUC1, including 16 MUC1 tandem repeats, was produced as a fusion protein with murine IgG Fc, with an intervening enterokinase cleavage site for the removal of the Fc tail. Stable MUC1-IgG-producing CHO-K1 clones were generated and were found to secrete MUC1-IgG into the culture medium. After adaptation to suspension culture in protein-free medium in a bioreactor, the fusion protein was secreted in large quantities (100 mg/l per day) into the culture supernatant. From there, MUC1 could be purified to homogeneity using a two-step procedure including enterokinase cleavage and ion-exchange chromatography. Capillary liquid chromatography MS of released oligosaccharides from CHO-K1-produced MUC1 identified the main O-glycans as Galbeta1-3GalNAc (core 1) and mono- and di-sialylated core 1. The glycans occupied on average 4.3 of the five potential O-glycosylation sites in the tandem repeats, as determined by nano-liquid chromatography MS of partially deglycosylated Clostripain-digested protein. A very similar O-glycan profile and site occupancy was found in MUC1-IgG produced in the breast carcinoma cell line T47D, which has O-glycosylation typical for breast cancer. In contrast, MUC1-IgG produced in another breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, showed a more complex pattern with both core 1- and core 2-based O-glycans. This is the first reported production of large quantities of recombinant MUC1 with a breast cancer-like O-glycosylation that could be used for the immunotherapy of breast cancer.

Impact of dynamic online fed-batch strategies on metabolism, productivity and N-glycosylation quality in CHO cell cultures. As we pursue the means to improve yields to meet growing therapy demands, it is important to examine the impact of process control on glycosylation patterns to ensure product efficacy and consistency. In this study, we describe a dynamic on-line fed-batch strategy based on low glutamine/glucose concentrations and its impact on cellular metabolism and, more importantly, the productivity and N-glycosylation quality of a model recombinant glycoprotein, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma). We found that low glutamine fed-batch strategy enabled up to 10-fold improvement in IFN-gamma yields, which can be attributed to reduced specific productivity of ammonia and lactate. Furthermore, the low glutamine concentration (0.3 mM) used in this fed-batch strategy could maintain both the N-glycosylation macro- and microheterogeneity of IFN-gamma. However, very low glutamine (<0.1 mM) or glucose (<0.70 mM) concentrations can lead to decreased sialylation and increased presence of minor glycan species consisting of hybrid and high-mannose types. This shows that glycan chain extension and sialylation can be affected by nutrient limitation. In addition to nutrient limitation, we also found that N-glycosylation quality can be detrimentally affected by low culture viability. IFN-gamma purified at low culture viability had both lower sialylation as well as glycans of lower molecular masses, which can be attributed to extensive degradation by intracellular glycosidases released by cytolysis. Therefore, in order to maintain good N-glycosylation quality, there is a need to consider both culture viability and nutrient control setpoint in a nutrient-limiting fed-batch culture strategy. A greater understanding of these major factors that affect N-glycosylation quality would surely facilitate future development of effective process controls.

Effect of production method and gene amplification on the glycosylation pattern of a secreted reporter protein in CHO cells. We have investigated the independent effects of selective gene amplification (using the dhfr amplifiable selection marker) and culture operating strategy (batch vs repeated fed-batch vs semicontinuous perfusion) on the glycosylation of a recombinant reporter protein (secreted alkaline phosphatase, SEAP) produced in transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. HPLC analyses coupled with susceptibility to various exoglycosidases were used to determine the N-glycosylation profile of SEAP samples. The dhfr amplified cell line yielded an almost 10-fold increase in specific productivity as compared to that of the unamplified cell line. The glycosylation pattern of the reporter protein produced in batch bioreactor cultures of the amplified cell line showed only slight differences as compared to the glycosylation pattern of the protein from batch bioreactor cultures of the unamplified cell line. In contrast, analysis of SEAP glycosylation structures from the protein isolated from semicontinuous perfusion cultures indicated that both relative glycan content and extent of sialylation were increased as compared to samples isolated from repeated fed-batch cultures. These results suggest that the slow growing perfusion cultures produce more completely glycosylated proteins than the faster growing repeated fed-batch cultures.

Comparison of cell lines for stable production of fucose-negative antibodies with enhanced ADCC. Several methods have been described to enhance antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) using different host cells that produce antibody with reduced levels of fucose on their carbohydrates. We compared the suitability of these methods for the serum-free fed-batch production of antibody for clinical trials and commercial uses. Recombinant anti-human CD20 chimeric IgG1-producing clones were established from host-cells that have been shown to produce more than 90% fucose-negative antibody. The cell lines were a FUT8 (alpha-1,6-fucosyltransferase) knockout Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line, Ms704, and two Lens culinaris agglutinin (LCA)-resistant cell lines, one derived from a variant CHO line, Lec13 and the other from a rat hybridoma cell line, YB2/0. The amount of fucose-negative antibody produced by Lec13 and YB2/0 significantly decreased with the culture. The increase in fucosylation was due to remaining synthesis of GDP-fucose via de novo pathway for the CHO line and the elevation of FUT8 expression by the YB2/0 cells. In contrast, Ms704 cells stably produced fucose-negative antibody with a consistent carbohydrate structure until the end of the culture. The productivity of the Ms704 cells reached 1.76 g/L with a specific production rate (SPR) of 29 pg/cell/day for 17 days in serum-free fed-batch culture using a 1 L spinner bioreactor. Our results demonstrate that FUT8 knockout has the essential characteristics of host cells for robust manufacture of fucose-negative therapeutic antibodies with enhanced ADCC.

Optimization of fed-batch parameters and harvest time of CHO cell cultures for a glycosylated product with multiple mechanisms of inactivation. Optimization of fed-batch feeding parameters was explored for a system with multiple mechanisms of product inactivation. In particular, two separate mechanisms of inactivation were identified for the recombinant tissue-type activator (r-tPA) protein. Dynamic inactivation models were written to describe particular r-tPA glycoform inactivation in the presence and absence of free-glucose. A glucose-independent inactivation mechanism was identified, and inactivation rate constants were found dependent upon the presence of glycosylation of r-tPA at N184. Inactivation rate constants of the glucose-dependent mechanism were not affected by glycosylation at N184. Fed-batch optimization was performed for r-tPA production by CHO cell culture in a stirred-tank reactor with glucose, glutamine and asparagine feed. Feeding profiles in which culture supernatant concentrations of free-glucose and amino acids (combined glutamine and asparagine) were used as control variables, were evaluated for a wide variety of set points. Simulation results for a controlled feeding strategy yielded an optimum at set points of 1.51 g L(-1) glucose and 1.18 g L(-1) of amino acids. Optimization was also performed in absence of metabolite control using fixed feed-flow rates initiate during the exponential growth phase. Fixed feed-flow results displayed a family of optimum solutions along a mass flow rate ratio of 3.15 of glucose to amino acids. Comparison of the two feeding strategies showed a slight advantage of rapid feeding at a fixed flow rate as opposed to metabolite control for a product with multiple mechanisms of inactivation.

Effect of culture temperature on erythropoietin production and glycosylation in a perfusion culture of recombinant CHO cells. To investigate the effect of culture temperature on erythropoietin (EPO) production and glycosylation in recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, we cultivated CHO cells using a perfusion bioreactor. Cells were cultivated at 37 degrees C until viable cell concentration reached 1 x 10(7) cells/mL, and then culture temperature was shifted to 25 degrees C, 28 degrees C, 30 degrees C, 32 degrees C, 37 degrees C (control), respectively. Lowering culture temperature suppressed cell growth but was beneficial to maintain high cell viability for a longer period. In a control culture at 37 degrees C, cell viability gradually decreased and fell below 80% on day 18 while it remained over 90% throughout the culture at low culture temperature. The cumulative EPO production and specific EPO productivity, q(EPO), increased at low culture temperature and were the highest at 32 degrees C and 30 degrees C, respectively. Interestingly, the cumulative EPO production at culture temperature below 32 degrees C was not as high as the cumulative EPO production at 32 degrees C although the q(EPO) at culture temperature below 32 degrees C was comparable or even higher than the q(EPO) at 32 degrees C. This implies that the beneficial effect of lowering culture temperature below 32 degrees C on q(EPO) is outweighed by its detrimental effect on the integral of viable cells. The glycosylation of EPO was evaluated by isoelectric focusing, normal phase HPLC and anion exchange chromatography analyses. The quality of EPO at 32 degrees C in regard to acidic isoforms, antennary structures and sialylated N-linked glycans was comparable to that at 37 degrees C. However, at culture temperatures below 32 degrees C, the proportions of acidic isoforms, tetra-antennary structures and tetra-sialylated N-linked glycans were further reduced, suggesting that lowering culture temperature below 32 degrees C negatively affect the quality of EPO. Thus, taken together, cell culture at 32 degrees C turned out to be the most satisfactory since it showed the highest cumulative EPO production, and moreover, EPO quality at 32 degrees C was not deteriorated as obtained at 37 degrees C.

High-level protein expression in scalable CHO transient transfection. Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) have been extensively utilized as the production platform for therapeutic proteins including monoclonal antibodies in pharmaceutical industry. For early development, it would be advantageous to rapidly produce large amounts of protein in the same cell line; therefore, development of a CHO transient transfection platform with high protein expression level is highly desirable. Here, we describe the development of such a platform in CHO cells. Polyethylenimine (PEI) was used as the transfection reagent. Different media were screened for the best transfection and expression performance, and UltraCHO was chosen as the best performer. DMSO and lithium acetate (LiAc) were discovered to improve CHO transient transfection expression levels significantly. A 14-day fed-batch process was successfully developed to further increase production yield. With an optimized transient transfection process, we were able to express monoclonal antibody (Mab) in CHO cells at a high level, averaging 80 mg/L. The process was successfully scaled up to 10 L working volume in a 20 L wave bioreactor. As expected, the Mabs had similar glycosylation patterns in comparison to the Mabs produced from a stably transfected CHO cell line, while in contrast Mabs expressed transiently from HEK293EBNA cells differed.

N-linked glycosylation is an important parameter for optimal selection of cell lines producing biopharmaceutical human IgG. We studied the variations in N-linked glycosylation of human IgG molecules derived from 105 different stable cell lines each expressing one of the six different antibodies. Antibody expression was based on glutamine synthetase selection technology in suspension growing CHO-K1SV cells. The glycans detected on the Fc fragment were mainly of the core-fucosylated complex type containing zero or one galactose and little to no sialic acid. The glycosylation was highly consistent for the same cell line when grown multiple times, indicating the robustness of the production and glycan analysis procedure. However, a twofold to threefold difference was observed in the level of galactosylation and/or non-core-fucosylation between the 105 different cell lines, suggesting clone-to-clone variation. These differences may change the Fc-mediated effector functions by such antibodies. Large variation was also observed in the oligomannose-5 glycan content, which, when present, may lead to undesired rapid clearance of the antibody in vivo. Statistically significant differences were noticed between the various glycan parameters for the six different antibodies, indicating that the variable domains and/or light chain isotype influence Fc glycosylation. The glycosylation altered when batch production in shaker was changed to fed-batch production in bioreactor, but was consistent again when the process was scaled from 400 to 5,000 L. Taken together, the observed clone-to-clone glycosylation variation but batch-to-batch consistency provides a rationale for selection of optimal production cell lines for large-scale manufacturing of biopharmaceutical human IgG.

Physiological responses of CHO cells to repetitive hydrodynamic stress. A majority of the previous investigations on the hydrodynamic sensitivity of mammalian cells have focused on lethal effects as determined by cell death or lysis. In this study, we investigated the effect of hydrodynamic stress on CHO cells in a fed-batch process using a previously reported system which subjects cells to repetitive, high levels of hydrodynamic stress, quantified by energy dissipation rate (EDR). The results indicated that cell growth and monoclonal antibody production of the test cells were very resistant to the hydrodynamic stress. Compared to the control, no significant variation was observed at the highest EDR tested, 6.4 x 10(6) W/m(3). Most product quality attributes were not affected by intense hydrodynamic stress either. The only significant impact was on glycosylation. A shift of glycosylation pattern was observed at EDR levels at or higher than 6.0 x 10(4) W/m(3), which is two orders of magnitude lower than the EDR where physical cell damage, as measured by lactate dehydrogenase release, was observed. While not as extensively investigated, a second monoclonal antibody produced in a different CHO clone exhibited the same glycosylation change at an intensive EDR, 2.9 x 10(5) W/m(3). Conversely, a low EDR of 0.9 x 10(2) W/m(3) had no effect on the glycosylation pattern. As 6.0 x 10(4) W/m(3), the lowest EDR that triggers the glycosylation shift, is about one order of magnitude higher than the estimated, maximum EDR in typically operated, large-scale stirred tank bioreactors, further studies in a lower EDR range of 1 x 10(3)-6.0 x 10(4) W/m(3) are needed to assess the glycosylation shift effect under typical large-scale bioreactor operation conditions. Follow-up studies in stirred tanks are also needed to confirm the glycosylation shift effect and to validate the repetitive hydrodynamic stress model.

Changes in the quality of antibodies produced by Chinese hamster ovary cells during the death phase of cell culture. Although overproduction of recombinant proteins by mammalian cells is well established, little attention has been paid to analysis of the quality of the products. We focused on the quality of antibodies produced during the death phase of a recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line. The quality of the monoclonal antibody against HM1.24 antigen and the post-translational characteristics of the subunits during CHO cell culture in a 160-L bioreactor were investigated. The culture supernatant of a stable cell line was collected and purified by affinity chromatography and then analyzed. There were no significant changes in gel-permeation chromatography variables, carbohydrate structure, or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activity during the death phase of cell culture. However, ion-exchange chromatography analysis revealed that antibody heterogeneity changed, as indicated by a decrease in cell viability. The results presented here provide useful information that will help in determining the time to end each batch culture.

Control of misincorporation of serine for asparagine during antibody production using CHO cells. A recombinant monoclonal antibody produced by Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell fed-batch culture was found to have amino acid sequence misincorporation upon analysis by intact mass and peptide mapping mass spectrometry. A detailed analysis revealed multiple sites for asparagine were being randomly substituted by serine, pointing to mistranslation as the likely source. Results from time-course analysis of cell culture suggest that misincorporation was occurring midway through the fed-batch process and was correlated to asparagine reduction to below detectable levels in the culture. Separate shake flask experiments were carried out that confirmed starvation of asparagine and not excess of serine in the medium as the root cause of the phenomenon. Reduction in serine concentration under asparagine starvation conditions helped reduce extent of misincorporation. Supplementation with glutamine also helped reduce extent of misincorporation. Maintenance of asparagine at low levels in 2 L bench-scale culture via controlled supplementation of asparagine-containing feed eliminated the occurrence of misincorporation. This strategy was implemented in a clinical manufacturing process and scaled up successfully to the 200 and 2,000 L bioreactor scales.

Defining process design space for monoclonal antibody cell culture. The concept of design space has been taking root as a foundation of in-process control strategies for biopharmaceutical manufacturing processes. During mapping of the process design space, the multidimensional combination of operational variables is studied to quantify the impact on process performance in terms of productivity and product quality. An efficient methodology to map the design space for a monoclonal antibody cell culture process is described. A failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) was used as the basis for the process characterization exercise. This was followed by an integrated study of the inoculum stage of the process which includes progressive shake flask and seed bioreactor steps. The operating conditions for the seed bioreactor were studied in an integrated fashion with the production bioreactor using a two stage design of experiments (DOE) methodology to enable optimization of operating conditions. A two level Resolution IV design was followed by a central composite design (CCD). These experiments enabled identification of the edge of failure and classification of the operational parameters as non-key, key or critical. In addition, the models generated from the data provide further insight into balancing productivity of the cell culture process with product quality considerations. Finally, process and product-related impurity clearance was evaluated by studies linking the upstream process with downstream purification. Production bioreactor parameters that directly influence antibody charge variants and glycosylation in CHO systems were identified.

Production of non-fucosylated antibodies by co-expression of heterologous GDP-6-deoxy-D-lyxo-4-hexulose reductase. All IgG-type antibodies are N-glycosylated in their Fc part at Asn-297. Typically, a fucose residue is attached to the first N-acetylglucosamine of these complex-type N-glycans. Antibodies lacking core fucosylation show a significantly enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and an increased efficacy of anti-tumor activity. In cases where the clinical efficacy of an antibody is to some extent mediated by its ADCC effector function, afucosylated N-glycans could help to reduce dose requirement and save manufacturing costs. Using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells as a model, we demonstrate here that heterologous expression of the prokaryotic enzyme GDP-6-deoxy-d-lyxo-4-hexulose reductase within the cytosol can efficiently deflect the fucose de novo pathway. Antibody-producing CHO cells that were modified in this way secrete antibodies lacking core fucose as demonstrated by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and HPAEC-PAD monosaccharide analysis. Engineering of the fucose de novo pathway has led to the construction of IgGs with a strongly enhanced ADCC effector function. The method described here should have broad practical applicability for the development of next-generation therapeutic antibodies.

Modulation of antibody galactosylation through feeding of uridine, manganese chloride, and galactose. Through process transfer and optimization for increased antibody production to 3 g/L for a GS-CHO cell line, an undesirable drop in antibody Fc galactosylation was observed. Uridine (U), manganese chloride (M), and galactose (G), constituents involved in the intracellular galactosylation process, were evaluated in 2-L bioreactors for their potential to specifically increase antibody galactosylation. These components were placed in the feed medium at proportionally increasing concentrations from 0 to 20 × UMG, where a 1× concentration of U was 1 mM, a 1× concentration of M was 0.002 mM, and a 1× concentration of G was 5 mM. Antibody galactosylation increased rapidly from 3% at 0× UMG up to 21% at 8× UMG and then more slowly to 23% at 20× UMG. The increase was primarily due to a shift from G0F to G1F, with minimal impact on other glycoforms or product quality attributes. Cell culture performance was largely not impacted by addition of up to 20× UMG except for suppression of glucose consumption and lactate production at 16 and 20× UMG and a slight drop in antibody concentration at 20× UMG. Higher accumulation of free galactose in the medium was observed at 8× UMG and above, coincident with achieving the plateau of maximal galactosylation. A concentration of 4× UMG resulted in achieving the target of 18% galactosylation at 2-L scale, a result that was reproduced in a 1,000-L run. Follow-up studies to evaluate the addition of each component individually up to 12× concentration revealed that the effect was synergistic; the combination of all three components gave a higher level of galactosylation than addition of the each effect independently. The approach was found generally useful since a second cell line responded similarly, with an increase in galactosylation from 5% to 29% from 0 to 8× UMG and no further increase or impact on culture performance up to 12× UMG. These results demonstrate a useful approach to provide exact and specific control of antibody galactosylation through manipulation of the concentrations of uridine, manganese chloride, and galactose in the cell culture medium.

Controlling glycation of recombinant antibody in fed-batch cell cultures. Protein glycation is a non-enzymatic glycosylation that can occur to proteins in the human body, and it is implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple chronic diseases. Glycation can also occur to recombinant antibodies during cell culture, which generates structural heterogeneity in the product. In a previous study, we discovered unusually high levels of glycation (>50%) in a recombinant monoclonal antibody (rhuMAb) produced by CHO cells. Prior to that discovery, we had not encountered such high levels of glycation in other in-house therapeutic antibodies. Our goal here is to develop cell culture strategies to decrease rhuMAb glycation in a reliable, reproducible, and scalable manner. Because glycation is a post-translational chemical reaction between a reducing sugar and a protein amine group, we hypothesized that lowering the concentration of glucose--the only source of reducing sugar in our fed-batch cultures--would lower the extent of rhuMAb glycation. When we decreased the supply of glucose to bioreactors from bolus nutrient and glucose feeds, rhuMAb glycation decreased to below 20% at both 2-L and 400-L scales. When we maintained glucose concentrations at lower levels in bioreactors with continuous feeds, we could further decrease rhuMAb glycation levels to below 10%. These results show that we can control glycation of secreted proteins by controlling the glucose concentration in the cell culture. In addition, our data suggest that rhuMAb glycation occurring during the cell culture process may be approximated as a second-order chemical reaction that is first order with respect to both glucose and non-glycated rhuMAb. The basic principles of this glycation model should apply to other recombinant proteins secreted during cell culture.

The genomic sequence of the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cell line. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-derived cell lines are the preferred host cells for the production of therapeutic proteins. Here we present a draft genomic sequence of the CHO-K1 ancestral cell line. The assembly comprises 2.45 Gb of genomic sequence, with 24,383 predicted genes. We associate most of the assembled scaffolds with 21 chromosomes isolated by microfluidics to identify chromosomal locations of genes. Furthermore, we investigate genes involved in glycosylation, which affect therapeutic protein quality, and viral susceptibility genes, which are relevant to cell engineering and regulatory concerns. Homologs of most human glycosylation-associated genes are present in the CHO-K1 genome, although 141 of these homologs are not expressed under exponential growth conditions. Many important viral entry genes are also present in the genome but not expressed, which may explain the unusual viral resistance property of CHO cell lines. We discuss how the availability of this genome sequence may facilitate genome-scale science for the optimization of biopharmaceutical protein production.

Cross validation of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and lectin array for monitoring glycosylation in fed-batch glycoprotein production. Glycosylation analysis of recombinant glycoproteins is of importance for the biopharmaceutical industry and the production of glycoprotein pharmaceuticals. A commercially available lectin array technology was evaluated for its ability to present a reproducible fingerprint of a recombinant CTLY4-IgG fusion glycoprotein expressed in large scale CHO-cell fermentation. The glycosylation prediction from the array was compared to traditional negative mode capillary LC-MS of released oligosaccharides. It was shown that both methods provide data that allow samples to be distinguished by their glycosylation pattern. This included information about sialylation, the presence of reducing terminal galactose β1-, terminal N-acetylglucosamine β1-, and antennary distribution. With both methods it was found that a general trend of increased sialylation was associated with an increase of the antenna and reduced amount of terminal galactose β1-, while N-acetylglucosamine β1- was less affected. LC-MS, but not the lectin array, provided valuable information about the sialic acid isoforms present, including N-acetylneuraminic acid, N-glycolylneuraminic acid and their O-acetylated versions. Detected small amounts of high-mannose structures by LC-MS correlated with the detection of the same epitope by the lectin array.

Growth, productivity and protein glycosylation in a CHO EpoFc producer cell line adapted to glutamine-free growth. A primary objective of cell line development and process optimisation in animal cell culture is the improvement of culture performance as indicated by desirable properties such as high cell concentration, viability, productivity and product quality. The inefficient energy metabolism of mammalian cells in culture is still a major limiting factor for improvements in process performance. It results in high uptake rates of glucose and glutamine and the concomitant accumulation of waste products which in turn limits final cell concentrations and growth. To avoid these negative side effects, a CHO host cell line was established recently which is able to grow in completely glutamine free medium (Hernandez Bort et al., 2010). To determine the influence of this adaptation on productivity and product quality, the same procedure was repeated with a recombinant CHO cell line producing an erythropoietin-Fc fusion protein (CHO-EpoFc) for this publication. After adaptation to higher cell densities and glutamine free medium, culture performance was monitored in batch bioprocesses and revealed comparable growth properties and EpoFc product formation in both cell lines. The level of reactive oxygen species was elevated in the adapted cells, reflecting a higher level of oxidative stress, however, at the same time the level of the oxido-protective glutathione was also higher, so that cells seem adequately protected against cellular damage. Analysis of nucleotides and nucleotide sugars revealed elevated UDP-sugars in cells grown in the absence of glutamine. Furthermore, the antennarity of N-glycans was moderately higher on the Epo part of the protein produced by the adapted cell line compared to the parental cell line. Except for this, the glycosylation, with respect to site occupancy, degree of sialylation and glycoform structure, was highly comparable, both for the Epo and the Fc part of the protein.

Production, characterization, and pharmacokinetic properties of antibodies with N-linked mannose-5 glycans. The effector functions of therapeutic antibodies are strongly affected by the specific glycans added to the Fc domain during post-translational processing. Antibodies bearing high levels of N-linked mannose-5 glycan (Man5) have been reported to exhibit enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) compared with antibodies with fucosylated complex or hybrid glycans. To better understand the relationship between antibodies with high levels of Man5 and their biological activity in vivo, we developed an approach to generate substantially homogeneous antibodies bearing the Man5 glycoform. A mannosidase inhibitor, kifunensine, was first incorporated in the cell culture process to generate antibodies with a distribution of high mannose glycoforms. Antibodies were then purified and treated with a mannosidase for trimming to Man5 in vitro. This 2-step approach can consistently generate antibodies with > 99% Man5 glycan. Antibodies bearing varying levels of Man5 were studied to compare ADCC and Fcγ receptor binding, and they showed enhanced ADCC activity and increased binding affinity to the FcγRIIIA. In addition, the clearance rate of antibodies bearing Man8/9 and Man5 glycans was determined in a pharmacokinetics study in mice. When compared with historical data, the antibodies bearing the high mannose glycoform exhibited faster clearance rate compared with antibodies bearing the fucosylated complex glycoform, while the pharmacokinetic properties of antibodies with Man8/9 and Man5 glycoforms appeared similar. In addition, we identified the presence of a mannosidase in mouse serum that converted most Man8/9 to Man6 after 24 h.

[Extracellular sialidase degrades sialic acid in recombinant human erythropoietin produced by an industrial Chinese hamster ovary cell strain]. To investigate the N-glycosylation characteristics of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) produced by an industrial Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line that is currently used in a large scale manufacturing process, we cultured this cell strain in static mode. The produced rhEPO in the culture supernatant was analyzed using isoelectric focusing (IEF) and Ricinus communis agglutinin-I (RCA-I) lectin precipitation. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and sialidase activity in the serum-free supernatant were assayed as well. The analyses revealed that this cell strain could produce rhEPO with high sialic acid content, but during prolonged culture, cell viability decreased with time whilst the activity of sialidase present in the supernatant increased. The loss in rhEPO quality was due to a decrease in terminal sialic acid on the N-glycans, caused by sialidase degradation. The methods and findings in this paper serve as basis for further investigation of industrial production process.

Case Study: an accelerated 8-day monoclonal antibody production process based on high seeding densities. This study describes the development work to shorten the monoclonal antibody (mAb) production time in CHO cell cultures from 14 days to 8 days without impacting mAb titer or product quality. The proposed process increases cell inoculation densities up to 25× higher than a typical seeding density in the final production bioreactor, with the implementation of an ATF™ perfusion system in the N - 1 stage. Similar antibody titer and N-glycosylation profiles were reached in 8 days using the 25× seed condition, as in 14 days using the 1× seed condition. Acidic variants in the 25× seed condition were 12-20% lower than the 1× seed condition. These results indicate that an accelerated 8-day antibody production process utilizing a 25× seeding strategy has the potential of achieving similar product quality and titer as the 1× seeding condition in a 14-day production process.

Highly sialylated recombinant human erythropoietin production in large-scale perfusion bioreactor utilizing CHO-gmt4 (JW152) with restored GnT I function. Therapeutic glycoprotein drugs require a high degree of sialylation of their N-glycans for a better circulatory half-life that results in greater efficacy. It has been demonstrated that Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) glycosylation mutants lacking N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GnT I), when restored by introduction of a functional GnT I, produced highly sialylated erythropoietin (EPO). We have now further engineered one of such mutants, JW152, by inactivating the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene to allow for the amplification of the EPO gene with methotrexate (MTX). Several MTX-amplified clones maintained the ability to produce highly sialylated EPO and one was selected for culture in a perfusion bioreactor that is used in an existing industrial EPO-production bioprocess. Extensive characterization of the EPO produced was performed using total sialic quantification, HPAEC-PAD and MALDI-TOF MS analyses. Our results demonstrated that the EPO produced by the mutant line exhibits superior sialylation compared to the commercially used EPO-producing CHO clone cultured under the same conditions. Therefore, this mutant has the industrial potential for producing highly sialylated recombinant EPO and potentially other recombinant glycoprotein therapeutics.

Trehalose suppresses antibody aggregation during the culture of Chinese hamster ovary cells. The aggregation of therapeutic antibodies during the manufacturing process is problematic because of the potential risks posed by the aggregates, such as an unexpected immune response. One of the hallmark effects of trehalose, a disaccharide consisting of two alpha-glucose units, is as a chemical chaperone with anti-aggregation activity. In this study, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line producing a diabody-type bispecific antibody were cultured in medium containing trehalose and the aggregation of the secreted proteins during the culture process was analyzed. An analysis of the various forms of the antibody (monomeric, dimeric, and large aggregates) showed that trehalose decreased the relative content of large aggregates by two thirds. The aggregation kinetics indicated that trehalose directly inhibited the polymerization and aggregation steps in a nucleation-dependent aggregation mechanism. Moreover, both specific and volumetric antibody production were increased in CHO cells cultured in trehalose-containing medium. Thus, the addition of trehalose to recombinant CHO cell cultures would offer a practical strategy for quality improvement in the production of therapeutic antibodies.

Glycosylation analysis of an aggregated antibody produced by Chinese hamster ovary cells in bioreactor culture. N-Glycosylation of therapeutic antibodies contributes not only to their biological function, but also to their stability and tendency to aggregate. Here, we investigated the impact of the glycosylation status of an aggregated antibody that accumulated during the bioreactor culture of Chinese hamster ovary cells. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that there was no apparent difference in the glycosylation patterns of monomeric, dimeric, and large aggregated forms of the antibody. In contrast, lectin binding assays, which enable the total amounts of specific sugar residues to be detected, showed that both galactose and fucose residues in dimers and large aggregates were reduced to 70-80% of the amount in monomers. These results strongly suggest that the lack of N-linked oligosaccharides, a result of deglycosylation or aglycosylation, occurred in a proportion of the dimeric and large aggregated components. The present study demonstrates that glycosylation heterogeneities are a potential cause of antibody aggregation in cell culture of Chinese hamster ovary cells, and that the lack of N-glycosylation promotes the formation of dimers and finally results in large aggregates.

Addition of valproic acid to CHO cell fed-batch cultures improves monoclonal antibody titers. Improving the productivity of a biopharmaceutical Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) fed-batch cell culture can enable cost savings and more efficient manufacturing capacity utilization. One method for increasing CHO cell productivity is the addition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors to the cell culture process. In this study, we examined the effect of valproic acid (VPA, 2-propylpentanoic acid), a branched-chain carboxylic acid HDAC inhibitor, on the productivity of three of our CHO cell lines that stably express monoclonal antibodies. Fed-batch shake flask VPA titrations on the three different CHO cell lines yielded cell line-specific results. Cell line A responded highly positively, cell line B responded mildly positively, and cell line C did not respond. We then performed factorial experiments to identify the optimal VPA concentration and day of addition for cell line A. After identifying the optimal conditions for cell line A, we performed verification experiments in fed-batch bioreactors for cell lines A and B. These experiments confirmed that a high dose of VPA late in the culture can increase harvest titer >20 % without greatly changing antibody aggregation, charge heterogeneity, and N-linked glycosylation profiles. Our results suggest that VPA is an attractive and viable small molecule enhancer of protein production for biopharmaceutical CHO cell culture processes.

Control of galactosylated glycoforms distribution in cell culture system. Cell culture process conditions including media components and bioreactor operation conditions have a profound impact on recombinant protein quality attributes. Considerable changes in the distribution of galactosylated glycoforms (G0F, G1F, and G2F) were observed across multiple CHO derived recombinant proteins in development at Eli Lilly and Company when switching to a new chemically defined (CD) media platform condition. In the new CD platform, significantly lower G0F percentages and higher G1F and G2F were observed. These changes were of interest as glycosylation heterogeneity can impact the effectiveness of a protein. A systematic investigation was done to understand the root cause of the change and control strategy for galactosylated glycoforms distribution. It was found that changes in asparagine concentration could result in a corresponding change in G0F, G1F, and G2F distribution. A follow-up study examined a wider range of asparagine concentration and it was found that G0F, G1F, and G2F percentage could be titrated by adjusting asparagine concentration. The observed changes in heterogeneity from changing asparagine concentration are due to resulting changes in ammonium metabolism. Further study ascertained that different integrated ammonium level during the cell culture process could control G0F, G1F, and G2F percentage distribution. A mechanism hypothesis is proposed that integrated ammonium level impacts intracellular pH, which further regulates β-1, 4 galactosyltransferase activity.

Identification of manipulated variables for a glycosylation control strategy. N-linked glycan distribution affects important end-use characteristics such as the bioactivity and efficacy of many therapeutic proteins, (including monoclonal antibodies), in vivo. Yet, obtaining desired glycan distributions consistently during batch-to-batch production can be challenging for biopharmaceutical manufacturers. While an appropriately implemented on-line glycosylation control strategy during production can help to ensure a consistent glycan distribution, to date no such strategies have been reported. Our goal is to develop and validate a comprehensive strategy for effective on-line control of glycosylation, the successful achievement of which requires first identifying appropriate manipulated variables that can be used to direct the glycan distribution to a desired state. While various culture conditions such as bioreactor process variables, media type, and media supplements have been shown to affect the glycan distribution, in this study we focus on the latter. Specifically, we implemented a statistically designed series of experiments to determine the significant main effects (as well as interaction effects) of media supplementation with manganese, galactose, ammonia and found that each had significant effects on certain glycans. We also include data indicating the glycosylation enzyme gene transcript levels as well as the intracellular nucleotide sugar concentrations in the presence of the media supplements to provide insight into the intracellular conditions that may be contributing to the changes in glycan distribution. The acquired experimental data sets were then used to identify which glycans can be controlled by the media supplements and to what degree. We determined that MnCl2 can be used as a manipulated variable to increase the relative abundance of M51 and decrease FA2 simultaneously, and galactose can be used as a manipulated variable to increase the relative abundance of FA2G1 and decrease FA2 and A2 simultaneously.

Effect of ambient light on monoclonal antibody product quality during small-scale mammalian cell culture process in clear glass bioreactors. During a small-scale cell culture process producing a monoclonal antibody, a larger than expected difference was observed in the charge variants profile of the harvested cell culture fluid (HCCF) between the 2 L and larger scales (e.g., 400 L and 12 kL). Small-scale studies performed at the 2 L scale consistently showed an increase in acidic species when compared with the material made at larger scale. Since the 2 L bioreactors were made of clear transparent glass while the larger scale reactors are made of stainless steel, the effect of ambient laboratory light on cell culture process in 2 L bioreactors as well as handling the HCCF was carefully evaluated. Photoreactions in the 2 L glass bioreactors including light mediated increase in acidic variants in HCCF and formulation buffers were identified and carefully analyzed. While the acidic variants comprised of a mixture of sialylated, reduced disulfide, crosslinked (nonreducible), glycated, and deamidated forms, an increase in the nonreducible forms, deamidation and Met oxidation was predominantly observed under light stress. The monoclonal antibody produced in glass bioreactors that were protected from light behaved similar to the one produced in the larger scale. Our data clearly indicate that care should be taken when glass bioreactors are used in cell culture studies during monoclonal antibody production.

Producing recombinant therapeutic glycoproteins with enhanced sialylation using CHO-gmt4 glycosylation mutant cells. Recombinant glycoprotein drugs require proper glycosylation for optimal therapeutic efficacy. Glycoprotein therapeutics are rapidly removed from circulation and have reduced efficacy if they are poorly sialylated. Ricinus communis agglutinin-I (RCA-I) was found highly toxic to wild-type CHO-K1 cells and all the mutants that survived RCA-I treatment contained a dysfunctional N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GnT I) gene. These mutants are named CHO-gmt4 cells. Interestingly, upon restoration of GnT I, the sialylation of a model glycoprotein, erythropoietin, produced in CHO-gmt4 cells was shown to be superior to that produced in wild-type CHO-K1 cells. This addendum summarizes the applicability of this cell line, from transient to stable expression of the recombinant protein, and from a lab scale to an industrial scale perfusion bioreactor. In addition, CHO-gmt4 cells can be used to produce glycoproteins with mannose-terminated N-glycans. Recombinant glucocerebrosidase produced by CHO-gmt4 cells will not require glycan remodeling and may be directly used to treat patients with Gaucher disease. CHO-gmt4 cells can also be used to produce other glycoprotein therapeutics which target cells expressing mannose receptors.

Recent advances in the understanding of biological implications and modulation methodologies of monoclonal antibody N-linked high mannose glycans. With the prevalence of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in the biopharmaceutical industry, the use of mammalian cell culture systems, particularly Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, has become the main method for the production of therapeutics. Despite their similarity to human cells, one major challenge of mammalian cell based biopharmaceutical production is controlling aberrant glycosylation, especially glycans with five to nine mannose residues-high mannose glycoforms. Glycosylation plays a critical role in determining the therapeutic profile of therapeutic glycoproteins; high mannose glycoforms in particular have been shown to have a significant impact on clinical efficacy and pharmacokinetics. Thus, producing glycoform profiles with consistent levels of high mannose is necessary to reduce batch-to-batch therapeutic variability and to meet regulatory standards. Studies have shown that high mannose glycoforms can be modulated through the genetic engineering of cell lines, addition of inhibitors to key enzymes in the glycosylation pathways, and varying cell culture conditions. Focusing on these three types of techniques, this review will examine and critically assess current methods for high mannose glycosylation control and future developments in this area.

Effects of nutrient levels and average culture pH on the glycosylation pattern of camelid-humanized monoclonal antibody. The impact of operating conditions on the glycosylation pattern of humanized camelid monoclonal antibody, EG2-hFc produced by Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells has been evaluated by a combination of experiments and modeling. Cells were cultivated under different levels of glucose and glutamine concentrations with the goal of investigating the effect of nutrient depletion levels and ammonia build up on the cell growth and the glycoprofiles of the monoclonal antibody (Mab). The effect of average pH reduction on glycosylation level during the entire culture time or during a specific time span was also investigated. The relative abundance of glycan structures was quantified by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and the galactosylation index (GI) and the sialylation index (SI) were determined. Lower initial concentrations of glutamine resulted in lower glucose consumption and lower cell yield but increased GI and SI levels when compared to cultures started with higher initial glutamine levels. Similarly, reducing the average pH of culture resulted in lower growth but higher SI and GI levels. These findings indicate that there is a tradeoff between cell growth, resulting Mab productivity and the achievement of desirable higher glycosylation levels. A dynamic model, based on a metabolic flux analysis (MFA), is proposed to describe the metabolism of nutrients, cell growth and Mab productivity. Finally, existing software (GLYCOVIS) that describes the glycosylation pathways was used to illustrate the impact of extracellular species on the glycoprofiles.

Use of a small molecule cell cycle inhibitor to control cell growth and improve specific productivity and product quality of recombinant proteins in CHO cell cultures. The continued need to improve therapeutic recombinant protein productivity has led to ongoing assessment of appropriate strategies in the biopharmaceutical industry to establish robust processes with optimized critical variables, that is, viable cell density (VCD) and specific productivity (product per cell, qP). Even though high VCD is a positive factor for titer, uncontrolled proliferation beyond a certain cell mass is also undesirable. To enable efficient process development to achieve consistent and predictable growth arrest while maintaining VCD, as well as improving qP, without negative impacts on product quality from clone to clone, we identified an approach that directly targets the cell cycle G1-checkpoint by selectively inhibiting the function of cyclin dependent kinases (CDK) 4/6 with a small molecule compound. Results from studies on multiple recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines demonstrate that the selective inhibitor can mediate a complete and sustained G0/G1 arrest without impacting G2/M phase. Cell proliferation is consistently and rapidly controlled in all recombinant cell lines at one concentration of this inhibitor throughout the production processes with specific productivities increased up to 110 pg/cell/day. Additionally, the product quality attributes of the mAb, with regard to high molecular weight (HMW) and glycan profile, are not negatively impacted. In fact, high mannose is decreased after treatment, which is in contrast to other established growth control methods such as reducing culture temperature. Microarray analysis showed major differences in expression of regulatory genes of the glycosylation and cell cycle signaling pathways between these different growth control methods. Overall, our observations showed that cell cycle arrest by directly targeting CDK4/6 using selective inhibitor compound can be utilized consistently and rapidly to optimize process parameters, such as cell growth, qP, and glycosylation profile in recombinant antibody production cultures.

A robust method for increasing Fc glycan high mannose level of recombinant antibodies. High mannose (HM) glycoforms on antibody Fc glycan are recognized as critical quality attributes for therapeutic antibody products. Methods to control HM have been largely empirical, and it is challenging to target a desired HM level during antibody process development. A novel and robust method to increase antibody HM glycoforms is demonstrated in this study using multiple antibodies and cell lines without adversely impacting cell culture performance, including viable cell density, viability, and protein titer. This approach utilizes mannose as a carbon source and the ratio of mannose to total hexose (glucose and mannose) in feed media determines the extent of HM glycan content of an antibody expressed in cell culture. Scale-up of this strategy from 3 mL small scale plate to bioreactor (1.5 L) is also demonstrated with comparable results. Further full glycan map analysis shows that HM increase predominantly correlates with the decrease in G0F glycan, with minimum impact on other glycoforms. Possible hypotheses for the HM glycan modulation using mannose as carbon source are also discussed. Three pathways, including GDP-mannose biosynthesis, early protein glycosylation and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine biosynthesis, might be involved and contribute to this HM modulation.

Monensin, a small molecule ionophore, can be used to increase high mannose levels on monoclonal antibodies generated by Chinese hamster ovary production cell-lines. Asparagine-linked glycosylation of the constant region of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) plays an important role in their stability and efficacy and is a critical product quality attribute that needs to be consistent between various process changes and production lots. Exact product quality match is also of the utmost importance for the development of biosimilar protein therapeutics. This poses a process development challenge since mAb glycosylation profiles can fluctuate easily with changes in process parameters. Therefore, there is a need to identify methods to modulate glycosylation levels on therapeutic antibodies during a production run in order to maintain consistent product quality profiles between different drug lots. Here, we demonstrate the use of a small molecule ionophore, monensin, to increase high mannose levels on multiple therapeutic human immunoglobulins (IgGs) in both plate-based small scale production models as well as in production bioreactors. This method is simple to implement and readily applicable for multiple production cell lines. Moreover, high mannose levels can be increased without significant negative impact on titer or cell culture performance. As such, monensin gives us a manipulable product quality lever.

Galactose supplementation enhance sialylation of recombinant Fc-fusion protein in CHO cell: an insight into the role of galactosylation in sialylation. Sialic acid levels of therapeutic glycoprotein play an important role in plasma half-life. An undesirable decrease of sialic acid content was observed when we increased Fc-fusion protein productivity fourfold in a GS-CHO cell line by bioprocess optimization. We investigated the potential mechanism for the sialic acid content reduction. We found that limited nucleotide sugar precursor and the extracellular sialidase were not responsible for the reduction of the sialic acid content after titer improvement. Oligosaccharide analysis revealed that the lack of protein galactosylation was the potential cause for the reduction of sialic acid content. Thus we validated this notion by evaluated galactose supplementation in 2 L bioreactors. Cell culture performance was not impacted by addition of up to 40 mM galactose except for the glucose consumption rate. Addition of 20 mM galactose to the bioreactor resulted in the increase of 44 % for total sialic acid content and 20.3 % for sialylated glycans. These data were further validated when the process was run on 200 L scaled bioreactor. These data together show that the galactosylation plays an apparent role in sialylation in our current system.

Glycoprofiling effects of media additives on IgG produced by CHO cells in fed-batch bioreactors. Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are mainly produced by heterologous expression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The glycosylation profile of the mAbs has major impact on the efficacy and safety of the drug and is therefore an important parameter to control during production. In this study, the effect on IgG N-glycosylation from feeding CHO cells with eight glycosylation precursors during cultivation was investigated. The study was conducted in fed-batch mode in bioreactors with biological replicates to obtain highly controlled and comparable conditions. We assessed charge heterogeneity and glycosylation patterns of IgG. None of the eight feed additives caused statistically significant changes to cell growth or IgG productivity, compared to controls. However, the addition of 20 mM galactose did result in a reproducible increase of galactosylated IgG from 14% to 25%. On the other hand, addition of 20 mM N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) reduced relative abundance of galactosylated IgG by 4%. Additionally, supplementation with 10 mM mannose slightly reduced GlcNAc occupancy of IgG. Overall, comparing the effects of IgG glycosylation, by supplementing the cell culture medium with glycosylation precursors during cultivation, revealed an application of these glycosylation precursors for modulating N-glycosylation of IgG.

Quick generation of Raman spectroscopy based in-process glucose control to influence biopharmaceutical protein product quality during mammalian cell culture. Mitigating risks to biotherapeutic protein production processes and products has driven the development of targeted process analytical technology (PAT); however implementing PAT during development without significantly increasing program timelines can be difficult. The development of a monoclonal antibody expressed in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line via fed-batch processing presented an opportunity to demonstrate capabilities of altering percent glycated protein product. Glycation is caused by pseudo-first order, non-enzymatic reaction of a reducing sugar with an amino group. Glucose is the highest concentration reducing sugar in the chemically defined media (CDM), thus a strategy controlling glucose in the production bioreactor was developed utilizing Raman spectroscopy for feedback control. Raman regions for glucose were determined by spiking studies in water and CDM. Calibration spectra were collected during 8 bench scale batches designed to capture a wide glucose concentration space. Finally, a PLS model capable of translating Raman spectra to glucose concentration was built using the calibration spectra and spiking study regions. Bolus feeding in mammalian cell culture results in wide glucose concentration ranges. Here we describe the development of process automation enabling glucose setpoint control. Glucose-free nutrient feed was fed daily, however glucose stock solution was fed as needed according to online Raman measurements. Two feedback control conditions were executed where glucose was controlled at constant low concentration or decreased stepwise throughout. Glycation was reduced from ∼9% to 4% using a low target concentration but was not reduced in the stepwise condition as compared to the historical bolus glucose feeding regimen.

Metabolic engineering of CHO cells to alter lactate metabolism during fed-batch cultures. Recombinant yeast pyruvate carboxylase (PYC2) expression was previously shown to be an effective metabolic engineering strategy for reducing lactate formation in a number of relevant mammalian cell lines, but, in the case of CHO cells, did not consistently lead to significant improvement in terms of cell growth, product titer and energy metabolism efficiency. In the present study, we report on the establishment of a PYC2-expressing CHO cell line producing a monoclonal antibody and displaying a significantly altered lactate metabolism compared to its parental line. All clones exhibiting strong PYC2 expression were shown to experience a significant and systematic metabolic shift toward lactate consumption, as well as a prolonged exponential growth phase leading to an increased maximum cell concentration and volumetric product titer. Of salient interest, PYC2-expressing CHO cells were shown to maintain a highly efficient metabolism in fed-batch cultures, even when exposed to high glucose levels, thereby alleviating the need of controlling nutrient at low levels and the potential negative impact of such strategy on product glycosylation. In bioreactor operated in fed-batch mode, the higher maximum cell density achieved with the PYC2 clone led to a net gain (20%) in final volumetric productivity.

S-Sulfocysteine simplifies fed-batch processes and increases the CHO specific productivity via anti-oxidant activity. Industrial fed-batch cultivation of mammalian cells is used for the production of therapeutic proteins such as monoclonal antibodies. Besides medium ensuring initial growth, feeding is necessary to improve growth, viability and antibody production. Established processes include a slight acidic main feed and a separate alkaline feed containing l-tyrosine and l-cysteine. Since l-cysteine is not stable at neutral pH, a new derivative, S-sulfocysteine, was tested in neutral pH feeds. In small scale fed-batch processes, the S-sulfocysteine process yielded a comparable maximum viable cell density, prolonged viability and increased titer compared to the two feed system. Bioreactor experiments confirmed the increase in specific productivity. In depth characterization of the monoclonal antibody indicated no change in the glycosylation, or charge variant pattern whereas peptide mapping experiments were not able to detect any integration of the modified amino acid in the sequence of the monoclonal antibody. Finally, the mechanism of action of S-sulfocysteine was investigated, and results pointed out the anti-oxidative potential of the molecule, mediated through an increase in superoxide dismutase enzyme levels and in the total intracellular glutathione pool. Finally, we propose that the increase in specific productivity obtained in the S-sulfocysteine process results from the anti-oxidative properties of the molecule.

A control strategy to investigate the relationship between specific productivity and high-mannose glycoforms in CHO cells. The integration of physiological knowledge into process control strategies is a cornerstone for the improvement of biopharmaceutical cell culture technologies. The present contribution investigates the applicability of specific productivity as a physiological control parameter in a cell culture process producing a monoclonal antibody (mAb) in CHO cells. In order to characterize cell physiology, the on-line oxygen uptake rate (OUR) was monitored and the time-resolved specific productivity was calculated as physiological parameters. This characterization enabled to identify the tight link between the deprivation of tyrosine and the decrease in cell respiration and in specific productivity. Subsequently, this link was used to control specific productivity by applying different feeding profiles. The maintenance of specific productivity at various levels enabled to identify a correlation between the rate of product formation and the relative abundance of high-mannose glycoforms. An increase in high mannose content was assumed to be the result of high specific productivity. Furthermore, the high mannose content as a function of cultivation pH and specific productivity was investigated in a design of experiment approach. This study demonstrated how physiological parameters could be used to understand interactions between process parameters, physiological parameters, and product quality attributes.

High-throughput profiling of nucleotides and nucleotide sugars to evaluate their impact on antibody N-glycosylation. Recent advances in miniaturized cell culture systems have facilitated the screening of media additives on productivity and protein quality attributes of mammalian cell cultures. However, intracellular components are not routinely measured due to the limited throughput of available analytical techniques. In this work, time profiling of intracellular nucleotides and nucleotide sugars of CHO-S cell fed-batch processes in a micro-scale bioreactor system was carried out using a recently developed high-throughput method based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS). Supplementation of various media additives significantly altered the intracellular nucleotides and nucleotide sugars that are inextricably linked to the process of glycosylation. The results revealed that UDP-Gal synthesis appeared to be particularly limiting whereas the impact of elevated UDP-GlcNAc and GDP-Fuc levels on the final glycosylation patterns was only marginally important. In contrast, manganese and asparagine supplementation altered the glycan profiles without affecting intracellular components. The combination of miniaturized cell cultures and high-throughput analytical techniques serves therefore as a useful tool for future quality driven media optimization studies.

Identifying a robust design space for glycosylation during monoclonal antibody production. Glycan distribution has been identified as a "critical quality attribute" for many biopharmaceutical products, including monoclonal antibodies. Consequently, determining quantitatively how process variables affect glycan distribution is important during process development to control antibody glycosylation. In this work, we assess the effect of six bioreactor process variables on the glycan distribution of an IgG1 produced in CHO cells. Our analysis established that glucose and glutamine media concentration, temperature, pH, agitation rate, and dissolved oxygen (DO) had small but significant effects on the relative percentage of various glycans. In addition, we assessed glycosylation enzyme transcript levels and intracellular sugar nucleotide concentrations within the CHO cells to provide a biological explanation for the observed effects on glycan distributions. From these results we identified a robust operating region, or design space, in which the IgG1 could be produced with a consistent glycan distribution. Since our results indicate that perturbations to bioreactor process variables will cause only small (even if significant) changes to the relative percentage of various glycans (<±1.5%)-changes that are too small to affect the bioactivity and efficacy of this IgG1 significantly-it follows that the glycan distribution obtained will be consistent even with relatively large variations in bioreactor process variables. However, for therapeutic proteins where bioactivity and efficacy are affected by small changes to the relative percentage of glycans, the same analysis would identify the manipulated variables capable of changing glycan distribution, and hence can be used to implement a glycosylation control strategy. © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

A comparison of orbitally-shaken and stirred-tank bioreactors: pH modulation and bioreactor type affect CHO cell growth and protein glycosylation. Orbitally shaken bioreactors (OSRs) support the suspension cultivation of animal cells at volumetric scales up to 200 L and are a potential alternative to stirred-tank bioreactors (STRs) due to their rapid and homogeneous mixing and high oxygen transfer rate. In this study, a Chinese hamster ovary cell line producing a recombinant antibody was cultivated in a 5 L OSR and a 3 L STR, both operated with or without pH control. Effects of bioreactor type and pH control on cell growth and metabolism and on recombinant protein production and glycosylation were determined. In pH-controlled bioreactors, the glucose consumption and lactate production rates were higher relative to cultures grown in bioreactors without pH control. The cell density and viability were higher in the OSRs than in the STRs, either with or without pH control. Volumetric recombinant antibody yields were not affected by the process conditions, and a glycan analysis of the antibody by mass spectrometry did not reveal major process-dependent differences in the galactosylation index. The results demonstrated that OSRs are suitable for recombinant protein production from suspension-adapted animal cells. © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

Process performance and product quality in an integrated continuous antibody production process. Continuous manufacturing is currently being seriously considered in the biopharmaceutical industry as the possible new paradigm for producing therapeutic proteins, due to production cost and product quality related benefits. In this study, a monoclonal antibody producing CHO cell line was cultured in perfusion mode and connected to a continuous affinity capture step. The reliable and stable integration of the two systems was enabled by suitable control loops, regulating the continuous volumetric flow and adapting the operating conditions of the capture process. For the latter, an at-line HPLC measurement of the harvest concentration subsequent to the bioreactor was combined with a mechanistic model of the capture chromatographic unit. Thereby, optimal buffer consumption and productivity throughout the process was realized while always maintaining a yield above the target value of 99%. Stable operation was achieved at three consecutive viable cell density set points (20, 60, and 40 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL), together with consistent product quality in terms of aggregates, fragments, charge isoforms, and N-linked glycosylation. In addition, different values for these product quality attributes such as N-linked glycosylation, charge variants, and aggregate content were measured at the different steady states. As expected, the amount of released DNA and HCP was significantly reduced by the capture step for all considered upstream operating conditions. This study is exemplary for the potential of enhancing product quality control and modulation by integrated continuous manufacturing. Biotechnol.

Advances in analytical methodologies to guide bioprocess engineering for bio-therapeutics. This study was performed to monitor the glycoform distribution of a recombinant antibody fusion protein expressed in CHO cells over the course of fed-batch bioreactor runs using high-throughput methods to accurately determine the glycosylation status of the cell culture and its product. Three different bioreactors running similar conditions were analysed at the same five time-points using the advanced methods described here. N-glycans from cell and secreted glycoproteins from CHO cells were analysed by HILIC-UPLC and MS, and the total glycosylation (both N- and O-linked glycans) secreted from the CHO cells were analysed by lectin microarrays. Cell glycoproteins contained mostly high mannose type N-linked glycans with some complex glycans; sialic acid was α-(2,3)-linked, galactose β-(1,4)-linked, with core fucose. Glycans attached to secreted glycoproteins were mostly complex with sialic acid α-(2,3)-linked, galactose β-(1,4)-linked, with mostly core fucose. There were no significant differences noted among the bioreactors in either the cell pellets or supernatants using the HILIC-UPLC method and only minor differences at the early time-points of days 1 and 3 by the lectin microarray method. In comparing different time-points, significant decreases in sialylation and branching with time were observed for glycans attached to both cell and secreted glycoproteins. Additionally, there was a significant decrease over time in high mannose type N-glycans from the cell glycoproteins. A combination of the complementary methods HILIC-UPLC and lectin microarrays could provide a powerful and rapid HTP profiling tool capable of yielding qualitative and quantitative data for a defined biopharmaceutical process, which would allow valuable near 'real-time' monitoring of the biopharmaceutical product.

Integrated Genome and Protein Editing Swaps α-2,6 Sialylation for α-2,3 Sialic Acid on Recombinant Antibodies from CHO. Immunoglobin G with α-2,6 sialylation has been reported to have an impact on antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and anti-inflammatory efficacy. However, production of antibodies with α-2,6 sialylation from Chinese hamster ovary cells is challenging due to the inaccessibility of sialyltransferases for the heavy chain N-glycan site and the presence of exclusively α-2,3 sialyltransferases. In this study, combining mutations on the Fc regions to allow sialyltransferase accessibility with overexpression of α-2,6 sialyltransferase produced IgG with significant levels of both α-2,6 and α-2,3 sialylation. Therefore, ST3GAL4 and ST3GAL6 genes were disrupted by CRISPR/Cas9 to minimize the α-2,3 sialylation. Sialidase treatment and SNA lectin blot indicated greatly increased α-2,6 sialylation level relative to α-2,3 sialylation for the α-2,3 sialyltransferase knockouts when combined with α-2,6 sialyltransferase overexpression. Indeed, α-2,3 linked sialic acids were not detected on IgG produced from the α-2,3 sialyltransferase knockout-α-2,6 sialyltransferase overexpression pools. Finally, glycoprofiling of IgG with four amino acid substitutions expressed from an α-2,3 sialyltransferase knockout-α-2,6 sialyltransferase stable clone resulted in more than 77% sialylated glycans and more than 62% biantennary disialylated glycans as indicated by both MALDI-TOF and LC-ESI-MS. Engineered antibodies from these modified Chinese hamster ovary cell lines will provide biotechnologists with IgGs containing N-glycans with different structural variations for examining the role of glycosylation on protein performance.

Analysis of Tubespins as a suitable scale-down model of bioreactors for high cell density CHO cell culture. High cell density (HCD) culture increases recombinant protein productivity via higher biomass. Compared to traditional fed-batch cultures, HCD is achieved by increased nutrient availability and removal of undesired metabolic components via regular medium replenishment. HCD process development is usually performed in instrumented lab-scale bioreactors (BR) that require time and labor for setup and operation. To potentially minimize resources and cost during HCD experiments, we evaluated a 2-week 50-mL Tubespin (TS) simulated HCD process where daily medium exchanges mimic the medium replacement rate in BR. To best assess performance differences, we cultured 13 different CHO cell lines in simulated HCD as satellites from simultaneous BR, and compared growth, metabolism, productivity and product quality. Overall, viability, cell-specific productivity and metabolism in TS were comparable to BR, but TS cell growth and final titer were lower by 25 and 15% in average, respectively. Peak viable cell densities were lower in TS than BR as a potential consequence of lower pH, different medium exchange strategy and dissolved oxygen limitations. Product quality attributes highly dependent on intrinsic molecule or cell line characteristics (e.g., galactosylation, afucosylation, aggregation) were comparable in both scales. However, product quality attributes that can change extracellularly as a function of incubation time (e.g., deamidation, C-terminal lysine, fragmentation) were in general lower in TS because of shorter residence time than HCD BR. Our characterization results and two case studies show that TS-simulated HCD cultures can be effectively used as a simple scale-down model for relative comparisons among cell lines for growth or productivity (e.g., clone screening), and for investigating effects on protein galactosylation. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

An Effective Bacterial Fucosidase for Glycoprotein Remodeling. Fucose is an important component of many oligo- and polysaccharide structures as well as glycoproteins and glycolipids, which are often associated with a variety of physiological processes ranging from fertilization, embryogenesis, signal transduction, and disease progression, such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammation, and cancer. The enzyme α-l-fucosidase is involved in the cleavage of the fucosidic bond in glycans and glycoconjugates, particularly the Fuc-α-1,2-Gal, Fuc-α-1,3/4-GlcNAc, and Fuc-α-1,6-GlcNAc linkages. Here, we report a highly efficient fucosidase, designated as BfFucH identified from a library of bacterial glycosidases expressed in E. coli from the CAZy database, which is capable of hydrolyzing the aforementioned fucosidic linkages, especially the α-1,6-linkage from the N-linked Fuc-α-1,6-GlcNAc residue on glycoproteins. Using BfFucH coupled with endoglycosidases and the emerging glycosynthases allows glycoengineering of IgG antibodies to provide homogeneous glycoforms with well-defined glycan structures and optimal effector functions.

Modulation and modeling of monoclonal antibody N-linked glycosylation in mammalian cell perfusion reactors. Mammalian cell perfusion cultures are gaining renewed interest as an alternative to traditional fed-batch processes for the production of therapeutic proteins, such as monoclonal antibodies (mAb). The steady state operation at high viable cell density allows the continuous delivery of antibody product with increased space-time yield and reduced in-process variability of critical product quality attributes (CQA). In particular, the production of a confined mAb N-linked glycosylation pattern has the potential to increase therapeutic efficacy and bioactivity. In this study, we show that accurate control of flow rates, media composition and cell density of a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell perfusion bioreactor allowed the production of a constant glycosylation profile for over 20 days. Steady state was reached after an initial transition phase of 6 days required for the stabilization of extra- and intracellular processes. The possibility to modulate the glycosylation profile was further investigated in a Design of Experiment (DoE), at different viable cell density and media supplement concentrations. This strategy was implemented in a sequential screening approach, where various steady states were achieved sequentially during one culture. It was found that, whereas high ammonia levels reached at high viable cell densities (VCD) values inhibited the processing to complex glycan structures, the supplementation of either galactose, or manganese as well as their synergy significantly increased the proportion of complex forms. The obtained experimental data set was used to compare the reliability of a statistical response surface model (RSM) to a mechanistic model of N-linked glycosylation. The latter outperformed the response surface predictions with respect to its capability and reliability in predicting the system behavior (i.e., glycosylation pattern) outside the experimental space covered by the DoE design used for the model parameter estimation. Therefore, we can conclude that the modulation of glycosylation in a sequential steady state approach in combination with mechanistic model represents an efficient and rational strategy to develop continuous processes with desired N-linked glycosylation patterns.

Cell culture media supplemented with raffinose reproducibly enhances high mannose glycan formation. Glycosylation plays a pivotal role in pharmacokinetics and protein physiochemical characteristics. In particular, effector functions including antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) can be desired, and it has been described that high-mannose species exhibited enhanced ADCC. In this work we present the trisaccharide raffinose as a novel cell culture medium supplement to promote high mannose N-glycans in fed-batch cultures, which is sought after in the development of biosimilars to match the quality profile of the reference medicinal product (RMP) also. Up to six-fold increases of high mannose species were observed with increasing raffinose concentrations in the medium of shaken 96-deepwell plates and shake tubes when culturing two different CHO cell lines in two different media. The findings were confirmed in a pH-, oxygen- and CO<sub>2</sub>-controlled environment in lab-scale 3.5-L bioreactors. To circumvent detrimental effects on cell growth and productivity at high raffinose concentrations, the media osmolality was adjusted to reach the same value independently of the supplement concentration. Interestingly, raffinose predominantly enhanced mannose 5 glycans, and to a considerably smaller degree, mannose 6. While the underlying mechanism is still not fully understood, minor effects on the nucleotide sugar levels have been observed and transcriptomics analysis revealed that raffinose supplementation altered the expression levels of a number of glycosylation related genes. Among many genes, galactosyltransferase was downregulated and sialyltransferase upregulated. Our results highlight the potential of cell culture medium supplementation to modulate product quality.

Exploring cellular behavior under transient gene expression and its impact on mAb productivity and Fc-glycosylation. Transient gene expression (TGE) is a methodology employed in bioprocessing for the fast provision of recombinant protein material. Mild hypothermia is often introduced to overcome the low yield typically achieved with TGE and improve specific protein productivity. It is therefore of interest to examine the impact of mild hypothermic temperatures on both the yield and quality of transiently expressed proteins and the relationship to changes in cellular processes and metabolism. In this study, we focus on the ability of a Chinese hamster ovary cell line to galactosylate a recombinant monoclonal antibody (mAb) product. Through experimentation and flux balance analysis, our results show that TGE in mild hypothermic conditions led to a 76% increase in q<sub>P</sub> compared to TGE at 36.5°C in our system. This increase is accompanied by increased consumption of nutrients and amino acids, together with increased production of intracellular nucleotide sugar species, and higher rates of mAb galactosylation, despite a reduced rate of cell growth. The reduction in biomass accumulation allowed cells to redistribute their energy and resources toward mAb synthesis and Fc-glycosylation. Interestingly, the higher capacity of cells to galactosylate the recombinant product in TGE at 32°C appears not to have been assisted by the upregulation of galactosyltransferases (GalTs), but by the increased expression of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II (GnTII) in this cell line, which facilitated the production of bi-antennary glycan structures for further processing.

Sustaining an efficient and effective CHO cell line development platform by incorporation of 24-deep well plate screening and multivariate analysis. Efficient and effective cell line screening is paramount toward a successful biomanufacturing program. Here we describe the implementation of 24-deep well plate (24-DWP) screening of CHO lines as part of the cell line development platform at AbbVie. Incorporation of this approach accelerated the identification of the best candidate lines for process development. In an effort to quantify and predict process performance comparability, we compared cell culture performance in and in shake flasks, for a panel of Chinese Hamster Ovary cell lines expressing a monoclonal antibody. The results in 24-DWP screening showed reduced growth profiles, but comparable viability profiles. Slow growers in 24-DWP achieved the highest productivity improvement upon scaling-up to shake flasks. Product quality of the protein purified from shake flasks and 24-DWP were also compared. The 24-DWP culture conditions were found to influence the levels of acidic species, reduce the G0 N-glycan species, and increase the high-mannose N-glycan species. Nevertheless, the identification of undesirable profiles is executed consistently with the scaled-up culture. We further employed multivariate data analysis to capture differences depending on the two scales and we could demonstrate that cell line profiles were adequately clustered, regardless of the vessel used for the development. In conclusion, the 24-DWP platform was reasonably predictive of the parameters crucial for upstream process development activities, and has been adapted as part of the AbbVie cell line development platform. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

Real-time monitoring of antibody glycosylation site occupancy by in situ Raman spectroscopy during bioreactor CHO cell cultures. The glycosylation of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), a known critical quality attribute, is often greatly modified during the production process by animal cells. It is essential for biopharmaceutical industries to monitor and control this glycosylation. However, current glycosylation characterization techniques involve time- and labor-intensive analyses, often carried out at the end of the culture when the product is already synthesized. This study proposes a novel methodology for real-time monitoring of antibody glycosylation site occupancy using Raman spectroscopy. It was first observed in CHO cell batch culture that when low nutrient concentrations were reached, a decrease in mAb glycosylation was induced, which made it essential to rapidly detect this loss of product quality. By combining in situ Raman spectroscopy with chemometric tools, efficient prediction models were then developed for both glycosylated and nonglycosylated mAbs. By comparing variable importance in projection profiles of the prediction models, it was confirmed that Raman spectroscopy is a powerful method to distinguish extremely similar molecules, despite the high complexity of the culture medium. Finally, the Raman prediction models were used to monitor batch and feed-harvest cultures in situ. For the first time, it was demonstrated that the concentrations of glycosylated and nonglycosylated mAbs could be successfully and simultaneously estimated in real time with high accuracy, including their sudden variations due to medium exchanges. Raman spectroscopy can thus be considered as a promising PAT tool for feedback process control dedicated to on-line optimization of mAb quality. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

Antibody glycoengineering strategies in mammalian cells. As a key parameter impacting functional and structural heterogeneity, protein glycosylation is a critical quality attribute for antibody biotherapeutic manufacturing. The glycan patterns on recombinant antibodies, particularly on the conserved fragment crystallizable (Fc) region, can have significant effects on an antibody's functional activities including clearance rate, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and anti-inflammatory activity. In this review, we examined specific glycan attachments (fucosylation, sialylation, galactosylation, high-mannose, and bisecting glycans) and their importance to antibody properties. Next, we summarized the recent and current achievements on controlling antibody glycoforms in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and other mammalian cells through multiple strategies including genetic engineering, protein engineering, media modification, and other emerging technologies. Further, the impact of one carbohydrate modification on other glycan structures is also described. Finally, approaches to generate desirable homogenous glycan profiles on antibodies are also detailed. By applying multiple complementary intracellular and extracellular strategies, biotechnologists are well on their ways to precisely tuning antibody glycoforms emerging from bioreactors in the coming decades.

An efficient method to control high mannose and core fucose levels in glycosylated antibody production using deoxymannojirimycin. Glycosylation on the Fc region of recombinant Immunoglobulin G (IgG) therapeutic antibodies is a critical protein quality attribute which may affect the efficacy and safety of the molecule. During the development of biosimilar therapeutics, adjustment of the glycosylation profile is required in order to match the reference innovator profile. Deoxymannojirimycin (DMJ), a known inhibitor of mannosidase, was used in this study to modulate the glycosylation pattern of antibodies. The effect of DMJ, at concentrations of 5 μM - 500 μM, on non-fucosylated glycoform levels was tested in the biosynthesis processes of two different IgG1 (IgG1 #A and IgG1 #B) using two Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines (CHO-DXB-11 and CHOK1SV, respectively) in Erlenmeyer flasks and in lab scale bioreactors. DMJ affected glycan forms in a dose response manner. At the highest concentration tested, DMJ reduced N-linked complex glycoform and core fucose levels by 15 and 14 fold, respectively, and increased high mannose level by 21 fold. 10 μM DMJ decreased IgG1 #A core fucose level in CHO-DXB-11 from 92% to 73% and increased high mannose level from 4% to 22% in Erlenmeyer flasks. Furthermore, in lab scale bioreactors, 15 μM DMJ decreased IgG1 #A core fucose level from 95% to 84% and increased high mannose level from 3% to 13%. Core fucose level of IgG1 #B in CHOK1SV was decreased from 81% to 73% using 10 μM DMJ in lab scale bioreactors while high mannose was increased from 6% to 15%. While affecting core fucose and high mannose levels, DMJ decreased maximum viable cell concentration by 16% and did not significantly affect cell productivity (less than 10%). This study demonstrated that DMJ can enable the control of core fucosylated and high mannose levels of IgG1 antibodies in a defined range.

Improving culture performance and antibody production in CHO cell culture processes by reducing the Warburg effect. Lactate is one of the key waste metabolites of mammalian cell culture. High lactate levels are caused by high aerobic glycolysis, also known as the Warburg effect, and are usually associated with adverse culture performance. Therefore, reducing lactate accumulation has been an ongoing challenge in the cell culture development to improve growth, productivity, and process robustness. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) plays a crucial role for the fate of pyruvate, as it converts pyruvate to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). The PDC activity can be indirectly increased by inhibiting the PDC inhibitor, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, using dichloroacetate (DCA), resulting in less pyruvate being available for lactate formation. Here, Chinese hamster ovary cells were cultivated either with 5 mM DCA or without DCA in various batch and fed-batch bioreactor processes. In all cultures, DCA increased peak viable cell density (VCD), culture length and final antibody titer. The strongest effect was observed in a fed batch with media and glucose feeding in which peak VCD was increased by more than 50%, culture length was extended by more than 3 days, and the final antibody titer increased by more than twofold. In cultures with DCA, lactate production and glucose consumption during exponential growth were on average reduced by approximately 40% and 35%, respectively. Metabolic flux analysis showed reduced glycolytic fluxes, whereas fluxes in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were not affected, suggesting that cultures with DCA use glucose more efficiently. In a proteomics analysis, only few proteins were identified as being differentially expressed, indicating that DCA acts on a posttranslational level. Antibody quality in terms of aggregation, charge variant, and glycosylation pattern was unaffected. Subsequent bioreactor experiments with sodium lactate and sodium chloride feeding indicated that lower osmolality, rather than lower lactate concentration itself, improved culture performance in DCA cultures. In conclusion, the addition of DCA to the cell culture improved culture performance and increased antibody titers without any disadvantages for cell-specific productivity or antibody quality.

Proteomic analysis of micro-scale bioreactors as scale-down model for a mAb producing CHO industrial fed-batch platform. The pharmaceutical production of recombinant proteins, such as monoclonal antibodies, is rather complex and requires proper development work. Accordingly, it is essential to develop appropriate scale-down models, which can mimic the corresponding production scale. In this work, we investigated the impact of the bioreactor scale on intracellular micro-heterogeneities of a CHO cell line producing monoclonal antibodies in fed-batch mode, using a 10 mL micro-bioreactor (ambr™) scale-down model and the corresponding 300 L pilot-scale bioreactor. For each scale, we measured the time evolution of the proteome, which enabled us to compare the impact of the bioreactor scale on the intracellular processes. Nearly absolute accordance between the scales was verified by data mining methods, such as hierarchical clustering and in-detail analysis on a single protein base. The time response of principal enzymes related to N-glycosylation was discussed, emphasizing major dissimilarities between the glycan fractions adorning the heavy chain and the corresponding protein abundance. The enzyme expression displayed mainly a constant profile, whereas the resulting glycan pattern changed over time. It is concluded that the enzymatic activity is influenced by the changing environmental conditions present in the fed-batch processes leading to the observed time-dependent variation.

Perfusion Cell Culture Decreases Process and Product Heterogeneity in a Head-to-Head Comparison With Fed-Batch. In this study, the authors compared the impacts of fed-batch and perfusion platforms on process and product attributes for IgG1- and IgG4-producing cell lines. A "plug-and-play" approach is applied to both platforms at bench scale, using commercially available basal and feed media, a standard feed strategy for fed-batch and ATF filtration for perfusion. Product concentration in fed-batch is 2.5 times greater than perfusion, while average productivity in perfusion is 7.5 times greater than fed-batch. PCA reveals more variability in the cell environment and metabolism during the fed-batch run. LDH measurements show that exposure of product to cell lysate is 7-10 times greater in fed-batch. Product analysis shows larger abundances of neutral species in perfusion, likely due to decreased bioreactor residence times and extracellular exposure. The IgG1 perfusion product also has higher purity and lower half-antibody. Glycosylation is similar across both culture modes. The first perfusion harvest slice for both product types shows different glycosylation than subsequent harvests, suggesting that product quality lags behind metabolism. In conclusion, process and product data indicate that intra-lot heterogeneity is decreased in perfusion cultures. Additional data and discussion is required to understand the developmental, clinical and commercial implications, and in what situations increased uniformity would be beneficial.

Scale-dependent manganese leaching from stainless steel impacts terminal galactosylation in monoclonal antibodies. N-linked glycosylation profiles are routinely characterized on mammalian-derived protein therapeutic products and achieving consistency in the product-associated glycan attributes is an important indicator that the manufacturing process is under control. More importantly, meeting target glycan profile is a common criterion for ensuring product efficacy. During laboratory process development and subsequent scale up for pilot demonstration for a monoclonal antibody program, discrepancies in the molecule's terminal galactosylation level at 2-L, 100-L, and 6,000-L scales were observed. Results from extensive investigations revealed the root cause as manganese leaching from the stainless steel components and that this leaching is dependent on exposed surface area and cultivation time. Although this metal impurity is only present at nanomolar concentrations and difficult to detect, a spike-in study demonstrated that this low level was sufficient to impact the protein glycosylation profiles. Surprisingly, the 2-L glass bioreactor setup exhibited the highest amount of exposure to stainless steel and resulted in both a greater degree of variability and higher overall levels of terminal galactosylation. The use of disposable vessels to minimize stainless steel surface exposure to the cell culture resulted in comparable terminal galactosylation levels to those measured in pilot and commercial bioreactors. The discovery of this leachable effect on the cell culture production process was an essential step in implementing appropriate process control. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

Supplementing glycosylation: A review of applying nucleotide-sugar precursors to growth medium to affect therapeutic recombinant protein glycoform distributions. Glycosylation is a critical quality attribute (CQA) of many therapeutic proteins, particularly monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and is a major consideration in the approval of biosimilar biologics due to its effects to therapeutic efficacy. Glycosylation generates a distribution of glycoforms, resulting in glycoproteins with inherent molecule-to-molecule heterogeneity, capable of activating (or failing to activate) different effector functions of the immune system. Glycoforms can be affected by the supplementation of nucleotide-sugar precursors, and related components, to culture growth medium, affecting the metabolism of glycosylation. These supplementations has been demonstrated to increase nucleotide-sugar intracellular pools, and impact glycoform distributions, but with varied results. These variations can be attributed to five key factors: Differences between cell platforms (enzyme/transporter expression levels); differences between recombinant proteins produced (glycan-site accessibility); the fermentation and sampling timeline (glucose availability and exoglycosidase accumulation); glutamine levels (affecting ammonia levels, which impact Golgi pH, as well as UDP-GlcNAc pools); and finally, a lack of standardized metrics for observing shifts in glycoform distributions (glycosylation indices) across different experiments. The purpose of this review is to provide detail and clarity on the state of the art of supplementation strategies for nucleotide-sugar precursors for affecting glycosylation in cell culture processes, and to apply glycosylation indices for standardized comparisons across the field.

pH excursions impact CHO cell culture performance and antibody N-linked glycosylation. pH excursions exist due to frequent base addition and environmental heterogeneity in large-scale bioreactors. Such excursions could lead to suboptimal culture performance. Here we investigated the impact of pH excursions on cell culture performance and N-linked glycosylation for three MAb-producing Chinese hamster ovary cell lines. Frequent pH excursions were introduced by bolus base addition (in total 2-6% of initial volume, fixed bolus addition distributed from day 2 to 8) into small-scale bioreactors. Base addition led to increase in osmolality, pCO<sub>2</sub>, and lactate production. Lactate production increase was mainly caused by increased culture pH due to base addition, and bolus addition led to higher glucose and lactate metabolic rates than continuous addition. For the three cell lines studied, antibody galactosylation increased with the increase in cultivating pH, correlating to the decrease in cell-specific productivity. Interestingly, pH excursions led to significantly higher galactosylation for one cell line, which also had a higher response to different cultivating pHs. On the other hand, there was no such substantial impact of pH excursions on galactosylation for the other two cell lines, both of which also had minimal response to cultivating pH. This suggests that the impact of pH excursions on antibody N-linked glycosylation is cell line specific and is closely related to cell line response to cultivating pH.

Differential gene expression of a feed-spiked super-producing CHO cell line. Feed supplements are concentrated cell culture media that contain a variety of nutrients, which can be added during a bioprocess. During fed-batch cultivation, feed media are typically added to a growing cell culture to maximize cell and product concentrations. In this study, only a single shot of feed medium was added on day 0 to a basal cell culture medium and compared to non-supplemented basal medium (feed-spiked at day 0 versus control experiments) by cultivation of a recombinant mAb expressing CHO cell line in batch mode under controlled conditions in a bioreactor. Since the feed-spike at day 0 was based on existing medium components without introducing additional supplements, a desirable process with decreased complexity was generated. Unlike cells in basal medium, feed-spiked cultures reached almost 2× higher peak cell concentrations (10 × 10<sup>6</sup> c/mL vs. 18 × 10<sup>6</sup> c/mL) and 3× higher antibody concentrations (0.8 g/L vs. 2.4 g/L). Batch process time and the integral over the viable cell count were similar for both process types. Constantly high cell-specific production rates in feed-spiked cultures (70 pg/cell/day) compared to continuously declining rates in basal medium (from 70 to 10 pg/cell/day) were responsible for an overall 70% higher cell-specific production rate and the higher product concentrations. To associate gene expression patterns to different process proceedings, transcriptome analysis was performed using microarrays. Several transcripts that are involved with glutamine de novo synthesis and citric acid cycle were significantly upregulated on several days in feed-spiked cultures. The top identified gene ontology (GO) terms related well to cell cycle and primary metabolism, cellular division as well as nucleobase formation or regulation, which indicated a more active proliferative state for feed-spiked cultures. KEGG biochemical pathway analysis and Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) further confirmed these findings from a complementary perspective. Moreover, several interesting gene targets, which have not yet been associated with recombinant protein expression, were identified that related to a higher proliferative state, growth, protein synthesis, cell-size control, metabolism, cell survival as well as genes that are associated with the control of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in feed-spiked cultures. Analysis of critical product quality attributes (i.e. glycosylation, charge variants and size distribution) showed that feed-spiking did not change antibody quality.

Comprehensive manipulation of glycosylation profiles across development scales. The extent and pattern of glycosylation on therapeutic antibodies can influence their circulatory half-life, engagement of effector functions, and immunogenicity, with direct consequences to efficacy and patient safety. Hence, controlling glycosylation patterns is central to any drug development program, yet poses a formidable challenge to the bio-manufacturing industry. Process changes, which can affect glycosylation patterns, range from manufacturing at different scales or sites, to switching production process mode, all the way to using alternative host cell lines. In the emerging space of biosimilars development, often times all of these aspects apply. Gaining a deep understanding of the direction and extent to which glycosylation quality attributes can be modulated is key for efficient fine-tuning of glycan profiles in a stage appropriate manner, but establishment of such platform knowledge is time consuming and resource intensive. Here we report an inexpensive and highly adaptable screening system for comprehensive modulation of glycans on antibodies expressed in CHO cells. We characterize 10 media additives in univariable studies and in combination, using a design of experiments approach to map the design space for tuning glycosylation profile attributes. We introduce a robust workflow that does not require automation, yet enables rapid process optimization. We demonstrate scalability across deep wells, shake flasks, AMBR-15 cell culture system, and 2 L single-use bioreactors. Further, we show that it is broadly applicable to different molecules and host cell lineages. This universal approach permits fine-tuned modulation of glycan product quality, reduces development costs, and enables agile implementation of process changes throughout the product lifecycle.

Nickel and cobalt affect galactosylation of recombinant IgG expressed in CHO cells. Glycosylation is an important product quality attribute of antibody biopharmaceuticals. It involves enzymatic addition of oligosaccharides on proteins by sequential action of glycosyltransferases and glycosidases in the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi. Some of these enzymes like galactosyltransferase and N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-I require trace metal cofactors. Variations in trace metal availability during production can thus affect glycosylation of recombinant glycoproteins such as monoclonal antibodies. Variability in trace metal concentrations can be introduced at multiple stages during production such as due to impurities in raw materials for culture medium and leachables from bioreactors. Knowledge of the effect of various trace metals on glycosylation can help in root-cause analysis of unintended variability in glycosylation. In this study, we investigated the effect of nickel and cobalt on glycosylation of recombinant IgG expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Nickel concentrations below 500 µM did not affect glycosylation, but above 500 µM it significantly decreases galactosylation of IgG. Cobalt at 50 µM concentration causes slight increase in G1F glycans (mono galactosylated) as previously reported. However, higher concentrations result in a small increase in G0F (non galactosylated) glycans. This effect of nickel and cobalt on galactosylation of recombinant IgG can be reversed by supplementation of uridine and galactose which are precursors to UDP-Galactose, a substrate for the enzymatic galactosylation reaction.

Process development for an inducible rituximab-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cell line. Inducible mammalian expression systems are becoming increasingly available and are not only useful for the production of cytotoxic/cytostatic products, but also confer the unique ability to uncouple the growth and production phases. In this work, we have specifically investigated how the cell culture state at the time of induction influences the cumate-inducible expression of recombinant rituximab by a GS-CHO cell line. To this end, cells grown in batch and fed-batch cultures were induced at increasing cell densities (1 to 10 × 10 <sup>6</sup> cells/mL). In batch, the cell specific productivity and the product yield were found to reduce with increasing cell density at induction. A dynamic feeding strategy using a concentrated nutrient solution applied prior and postinduction allowed to significantly increase the integral of viable cells and led to a 3-fold increase in the volumetric productivity (1.2 g/L). The highest product yields were achieved for intermediate cell densities at induction, as cultures induced during the late exponential phase (10 × 10 <sup>6</sup> cells/mL) were associated with a shortened production phase. The final glycosylation patterns remained however similar, irrespective of the cell density at induction. The kinetics of growth and production in a 2 L bioreactor were largely comparable to shake flasks for a similar cell density at induction. The degree of galactosylation was found to decrease over time, but the final glycan distribution at harvest was consistent to that of the shake flasks cultures. Taken together, our results provide useful insights for the rational development of fed-batch cell culture processes involving inducible CHO cells. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

Impact of cell culture media additives on IgG glycosylation produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Glycosylation is a key critical quality attribute for monoclonal antibodies and other recombinant proteins because of its impact on effector mechanisms and half-life. In this study, a variety of compounds were evaluated for their ability to modulate glycosylation profiles of recombinant monoclonal antibodies produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Compounds were supplemented into the cell culture feed of fed-batch experiments performed with a CHO K1 and a CHO DG44 cell line expressing a recombinant immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1). Experiments were performed in spin tubes or the ambr®15 controlled bioreactor system, and the impact of the compounds at various concentrations was determined by monitoring the glycosylation profile of the IgG and cell culture parameters, such as viable cell density, viability, and titer. Results indicate that the highest impact on mannosylation was achieved through 15 µM kifunensine supplementation leading to an 85.8% increase in high-mannose containing species. Fucosylation was reduced by 76.1% through addition of 800 µM 2-F-peracetyl fucose. An increase of 40.9% in galactosylated species was achieved through the addition of 120 mM galactose in combination with 48 µM manganese and 24 µM uridine. Furthermore, 6.9% increased sialylation was detected through the addition of 30 µM dexamethasone in combination with the same manganese, uridine, and galactose mixture used to increase total galactosylation. Further compounds or combinations of additives were also efficient at achieving a smaller overall glycosylation modulation, required, for instance, during the development of biosimilars. To the best of our knowledge, no evaluation of the efficacy of such a variety of compounds in the same cell culture system has been described. The studied cell culture media additives are efficient modulators of glycosylation and are thus a valuable tool to produce recombinant glycoproteins.

The effect of hyperosmolality application time on production, quality, and biopotency of monoclonal antibodies produced in CHO cell fed-batch and perfusion cultures. Hyperosmolality has been commonly investigated due to its effects on the production and quality characteristics of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) produced in CHO cell fed-batch cultures. However, the application of hyperosmolality at different times and its effect on biopotency have seldom been researched, especially in perfusion culture. In our study, different degrees of hyperosmolality induced by sodium chloride were investigated in anti-IgE rCHO cell fed-batch cultures and anti-CD52 rCHO cell perfusion cultures during the initial and stable phases. The results showed that the initial hyperosmolality group (IHG) in fed-batch and early phase of perfusion cultures exhibited significant suppression of the viable cell density yet an enhancement in specific productivity, whereas the stable hyperosmolality group (SHG) achieved higher mAb production in both fed-batch and perfusion cultures. Additionally, the SHG produced less aggregates and acidic charge variants than IHG in fed-batch culture, which differed from perfusion cultures. However, the contents of non-glycosylation heavy chain (NGHC) and man5 were higher in SHG than in IHG in fed-batch cultures at plus 60 and 120 mOsm/kg, which was similar to perfusion cultures. Furthermore, the biopotency in the IHG was higher than in the SHG at plus 60 and 120 mOsm/kg in fed-batch cultures, which is similar to complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) efficacy in perfusion cultures. The biopotency of all group was acceptable, except FI3. Thus, the study shows that hyperosmolality at a certain level could be beneficial for both mAb production, quality and biopotency, which could play an important role in process development for commercial production.

Interaction of cell culture process parameters for modulating mAb afucosylation. The extent of afucosylation, which refers to the absence of core fucose on Fc glycans, can correlate positively with the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity of a monoclonal antibody (mAb). Therefore, it is important to maintain consistent afucosylation during cell culture process scale-up in bioreactors for a mAb with ADCC activity. However, there is currently a lack of understanding about the impact of partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO<sub>2</sub> )-a parameter that can vary with bioreactor scale-on afucosylation. Using a small-scale (3 L) bioreactor model that can modulate pCO <sub>2</sub> levels through modified configurations and gassing strategies, we identified three cell culture process parameters that influence afucosylation of a mAb produced by a recombinant Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line: pCO <sub>2</sub> , media hold duration (at 37°C), and manganese. These three-independent parameters demonstrated a synergistic effect on mAb afucosylation; increase in pCO <sub>2</sub> , media hold duration, and manganese consistently increased afucosylation. Our investigations into the underlying mechanisms through proteomic analysis indicated that the synergistic interactions downregulated pathways related to guanosine diphosphate-fucose synthesis and fucosylation, and upregulated manganese transport into the CHO cells. These new findings highlight the importance of considering potential differences in culture environment and operations across bioreactor scales, and understanding the impact of their interactions on product quality.

Analysis of Golgi pH in Chinese hamster ovary cells using ratiometric pH-sensitive fluorescent proteins. Acidic Golgi pH plays an important role in protein glycosylation, one of the critical quality attributes of therapeutic proteins. To determine the intracellular Golgi pH during culture, stable Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell clones expressing pHluorin2, a ratiometric pH-sensitive fluorescent protein (FP), in the cis- and trans-Golgi, were constructed by fusing pHluorin2 with specific targeting proteins, acetylglucosaminyltransferase, and a galactosyltransferase, respectively. Stable CHO cell clones expressing pHluorin2 in the cytoplasm were also constructed. The subcellular localization of FPs was confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis. Live-cell imaging revealed that the intracellular pH (pHi) of clones expressing the ratiometric pH-sensitive FPs converged to a specific pH range (cis-Golgi: 6.4-6.5; trans-Golgi: 5.9-6.0; and cytoplasm: 7.1-7.2). The pHi was successfully evaluated in various culture conditions. Although culture pH was maintained at 7.2 in a bioreactor, the Golgi pH increased with culture time. Elevated ammonia concentration and osmolality were partially responsible for the increased Golgi pH during bioreactor cultures. Taken together, the application of ratiometric pH-sensitive FPs in monitoring the Golgi pH of CHO cells during culture provides a new perspective to improve protein glycosylation through pHi control.

Control of IgG glycosylation by in situ and real-time estimation of specific growth rate of CHO cells cultured in bioreactor. The cell-specific growth rate (µ) is a critical process parameter for antibody production processes performed by animal cell cultures, as it describes the cell growth and reflects the cell physiological state. When there are changes in these parameters, which are indicated by variations of µ, the synthesis and the quality of antibodies are often affected. Therefore, it is essential to monitor and control the variations of µto assure the antibody production and achieve high product quality. In this study, a novel approach for on-line estimation of µ was developed based on the process analytical technology initiative by using an in situ dielectric spectroscopy. Critical moments, such as significant µ decreases, were successfully detected by this method, in association with changes in cell physiology as well as with an accumulation of nonglycosylated antibodies. Thus, this method was used to perform medium renewals at the appropriate time points, maintaining the values of µ close to its maximum. Using this method, we demonstrated that the physiological state of cells remained stable, the quantity and the glycosylation quality of antibodies were assured at the same time, leading to better process performances compared with the reference feed-harvest cell cultures carried out by using off-line nutrient measurements.

Process intensification for the production of rituximab by an inducible CHO cell line. Mammalian-inducible expression systems are increasingly available and offer an attractive platform for the production of recombinant proteins. In this work, we have conducted process development for a cumate-inducible GS-CHO cell-line-expressing rituximab. To cope with the limitations encountered in batch when inducing at high cell densities, we have explored the use of fed-batch, sequential medium replacements, and continuous perfusion strategies applied during the pre-induction (growth) phase to enhance process performance in terms of product yield and quality. In shake flask, a fed-batch mode and a complete medium exchange at the time of induction were shown to significantly increase the integral of viable cell concentration and antibody titer compared to batch culture. Further enhancement of product yield was achieved by combining bolus concentrated feed additions with sequential medium replacement, but product galactosylation was reduced compared to fed-batch mode, as a result of the extended culture duration. In bioreactor, combining continuous perfusion of the basal medium with bolus daily feeding during the pre-induction period and harvesting earlier during the production phase is shown to provide a good trade-off between antibody titer and product galactosylation. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of selecting a suitable operating mode and harvest time when carrying out high-cell-density induction to balance between culture productivity and product quality.

Assessment of fed-batch cultivation strategies for an inducible CHO cell line. In order to maximize cell growth and productivity for an inducible CHO cell line expressing rituximab, various fed-batch culture strategies were investigated. In each case, the performance was evaluated for cultures induced at moderate and high cell density conditions (4 × 10<sup>6</sup> and 10 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL) to assess the impact of the timing of induction. We first demonstrate the importance of starting the feeding process during the growth phase, as this translated into significantly improved integral of viable cells and antibody concentration, when compared to post-induction feeding only. Secondly, we investigated the impact of the feed rate by maintaining different levels of glucose (25, 35 and 50 mM) via a dynamic feeding strategy. The highest antibody concentrations were achieved under a moderate feeding regime for both cell densities at induction, highlighting the risks of under- or over-feeding the cultures. We then evaluated the impact of performing a temperature shift at induction by testing different mild hypothermia conditions. At small-scale, the highest production yields (1.2 g/L) were achieved when the temperature was reduced from 37 to 30 °C during the production phase of a culture induced at high cell density. When the strategy was applied in bioreactor, the better controlled conditions led to even greater product concentrations (1.8 g/L). Furthermore, this production protocol was shown to promote a more galactosylated glycan profile than a bioreactor culture initiated at 34 °C during growth and downshifted to 30 °C during the production phase.

Bioprocess development of a stable FUT8<sup>-/-</sup>-CHO cell line to produce defucosylated anti-HER2 antibody. In recent years, an increasing number of defucosylated therapeutic antibodies have been applied in clinical practices due to their better efficacy compared to fucosylated counterparts. The establishment of stable and clonal manufacturing cell lines is the basis of therapeutic antibodies production. Bioprocess development of a new cell line is necessary for its future applications in the biopharmaceutical industry. We engineered a stable cell line expressing defucosylated anti-HER2 antibody based on an established α-1,6-fucosyltransferase (FUT8) gene knockout CHO-S cell line. The optimization of medium and feed was evaluated in a small-scale culture system. Then the optimal medium and feed were scaled up in a bioreactor system. After fed-batch culture over 13 days, we evaluated the cell growth, antibody yield, glycan compositions and bioactivities. The production of anti-HER2 antibody from the FUT8 gene knockout CHO-S cells in the bioreactor increased by 37% compared to the shake flask system. The N-glycan profile of the produced antibody was consistent between the bioreactor and shake flask system. The antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activity of the defucosylated antibody increased 14-fold compared to the wild-type antibody, which was the same as our previous results. The results of our bioprocess development demonstrated that the engineered cell line could be developed to a biopharmaceutical industrial cell line.

Insights into the loss of protein sialylation in an fc-fusion protein-producing CHO cell bioprocess. Sialylation affects circulating half-life, charge distribution, and other biochemical properties of therapeutic glycoproteins. Loss of protein sialylation during glycoprotein-producing bioprocesses could lead to a low final protein sialylation level and bring negative effects on subsequent clinical efficacy. In this work, an Fc-fusion protein-producing Chinese hamster ovary cell fed-batch culture process was studied and insights into the loss of protein sialylation during the Fc-fusion protein production phase (days 5 to 13) were presented. The results showed that the decreased total sialic acid content was 13.84 μg/mg during the production phase, which accounted for 24% of the total sialic acid content on day 5. The lost sialic acids were predominantly from α 2-3 sialylation on N- and O-glycans. Through cell-free incubation and kinetics studies, it was found that the decreased sialic acid content caused by extracellular sialic acid degradation and incomplete glycan biosynthesis were 7.79 μg/mg and 6.05 μg/mg, respectively. The two processes had a nearly equal contribution to the loss of final product sialylation. Detailed characterizations revealed that decreases in sialic acid content were due either to extracellular sialic acid degradation via hydrolysis of α 2-3 sialic acids probably by released cytosolic sialidase or to a lack of galactosylated glycan availability for sialylation during late-stage glycosylation. Our work provides a better understanding of losses in protein sialylation during glycoprotein manufacturing.

Lectin bio-layer interferometry for assessing product quality of Fc- glycosylated immunoglobulin G. Glycosylation, as the most prominent posttranslational modification, is recognized as an important quality attribute of monoclonal antibodies affected by various bioprocess parameters and cellular physiology. A method of lectin-based bio-layer interferometry (LBLI) to relatively rank galactosylation and fucosylation levels was developed. For this purpose, Fc-glycosylated immunoglobulin G (IgG) was recombinantly produced with varying bioprocess conditions in 15 L bioreactor and accumulated IgG was harvested. The reliability, the robustness and the applicability of LBLI to different samples has been proven. Data obtained from LC-MS analysis served as reference and were compared to the LBLI results. The introduced method is based on non-fluidic bio-layer interferometry (BLI), which becomes recently a standard tool for determining biomolecular interactions in a label-free, real-time and high-throughput manner. For the intended purpose, biotinylated lectins were immobilized on disposable optical fiber streptavidin (SA) biosensor tips. Aleuria aurantia lectin (AAL) was used to detect the core fucose and Ricinus communis agglutinin 120 (RCA120) to determine galactosylation levels. In our case study it could be shown that fucosylation was not affected by variations in glucose feed concentration and cultivation temperature. However, the galactosylation could be correlated with the ratio of mean specific productivity (q<sub>P</sub> ) and ammonium (q<sub>NH4+</sub> ) but was unrelated to the ratio of mean q<sub>P</sub> and the specific glucose consumption (q<sub>gluc</sub> ). This presented method strengthens the applicability of the BLI platform, which already enables measurement of several product related characteristics, such as product quantity as well as kinetic rates (k<sub>d</sub> ,k<sub>on</sub> ) and affinity constants (k<sub>D</sub> ) analysis.

Multivariate data analysis of growth medium trends affecting antibody glycosylation. Use of multivariate data analysis for the manufacturing of biologics has been increasing due to more widespread use of data-generating process analytical technologies (PAT) promoted by the US FDA. To generate a large dataset on which to apply these principles, we used an in-house model CHO DG44 cell line cultured in automated micro bioreactors alongside PAT with four commercial growth media focusing on antibody quality through N-glycosylation profiles. Using univariate analyses, we determined that different media resulted in diverse amounts of terminal galactosylation, high mannose glycoforms, and aglycosylation. Due to the amount of in-process data generated by PAT instrumentation, multivariate data analysis was necessary to ascertain which variables best modeled our glycan profile findings. Our principal component analysis revealed components that represent the development of glycoforms into terminally galacotosylated forms (G1F and G2F), and another that encompasses maturation out of high mannose glycoforms. The partial least squares model additionally incorporated metabolic values to link these processes to glycan outcomes, especially involving the consumption of glutamine. Overall, these approaches indicated a tradeoff between cellular productivity and product quality in terms of the glycosylation. This work illustrates the use of multivariate analytical approaches that can be applied to complex bioprocessing problems for identifying potential solutions.

Impact of Acetylated and Non-Acetylated Fucose Analogues on IgG Glycosylation. The biological activity of therapeutic antibodies is highly influenced by their glycosylation profile. A valuable method for increasing the cytotoxic efficacy of antibodies, which are used, for example, in cancer treatment, is the reduction of core fucosylation, as this enhances the elimination of target cells through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Development of fucose analogues is currently the most promising strategy to reduce core fucosylation without cell line engineering. Since peracetylated sugars display enhanced cell permeability over the highly polar free hydroxy sugars, this work sought to compare the efficacy of peracetylated sugars to their unprotected forms. Two potent fucose analogues, 2-deoxy-2-fluorofucose and 5-alkynylfucose, and their acetylated forms were compared for their effects on fucosylation. 5-alkynylfucose proved to be more potent than 2-deoxy-2-fluorofucose at reducing core fucosylation but was associated with a significant higher incorporation of the alkynylated fucose analogue. Acetylation of the sugar yielded only slightly lower fucosylation levels suggesting that acetylation has a minor impact on cellular entry. Even though the efficacy of all tested components was confirmed, results presented in this study also show a significant incorporation of unnatural fucose analogues into the glycosylation pattern of the produced IgG, with unknown effect on safety and potency of the monoclonal antibody.

A study on enhanced O-glycosylation strategy for improved production of recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a glycoprotein hormone that exists as a heterodimer comprised of an α subunit and β subunit linked with disulfide bridges. The β subunit contains four O-glycosylation sites. Previous studies have found that the translation of mRNA to polypeptides of the β subunit was a severely limiting step for the expression of recombinant hCG protein in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The effects of O-glycosylation on recombinant hCG protein expression were assessed by adding O-glycan precursors and overexpressing and knocking down key regulatory genes of O-glycan precursor synthesis and O-glycan sugar chain synthesis or hydrolases. The results indicated that O-glycosylation was indeed limiting in the expression of recombinant hCG protein, and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) was the major limiting precursor. Glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 2 (Gfat2) and Uridine diphosphate-glucose pyrophosphorylase 2 (Ugp2), key regulatory genes of O-glycan precursor synthesis, were overexpressed. Ugp2 overexpression significantly increased the recombinant hCG protein level by 1.92 times compared to that of the control. The LC-MS/MS analysis and Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) lectin blot analysis showed that Ugp2 overexpression significantly increased the total galactosylation levels of intracellular proteins and the O-glycosylation of recombinant hCG protein. The stability of the hCG protein to trypsin digestion was also enhanced. Ugp2 is the major limiting enzyme of the O-glycan precursor synthesis in recombinant hCG protein production. Furthermore, the effects and mechanisms of the key genes of O-glycan sugar chain synthesis and hydrolases such as polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase1 (Galnt1), Core 1 synthase, glycoprotein-N-acetylgalactosamine 3-beta-galactosyltransferase (C1galt1), O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase (Ogt) and Hexosaminidase (Hex), were evaluated. The results indicated that Galnt1 overexpression increased the recombinant hCG protein level by 1.57 times and improved the total galactosylation of intracellular proteins, O-glycosylation and the stability of recombinant hCG protein. Galnt1 is the major limiting enzyme of O-glycan sugar chain synthesis. Overexpression of Ugp2 and Galnt1 simultaneously improved the recombinant hCG protein level by 2.44 times, and both had synergistic effects. Based on the results of overexpression of Galnt1, the major limiting gene of O-Glycan chain synthesis, the precursors GalNAc and Gal were added and increased the recombinant hCG protein level by 3.68 times. This study revealed the major limiting factors of O-glycosylation of recombinant hCG protein in CHO cells and proposed an effective expression regulation strategy.

Online control of cell culture redox potential prevents antibody interchain disulfide bond reduction. The phenomenon of monoclonal antibody (mAb) interchain disulfide bond reduction during manufacturing processes continues to be a focus of the biotechnology industry due to the potential for loss of product, increased complexity of purification processes, and reduced stability of the drug product. We hypothesized that antibody reduction can be mitigated by controlling the cell culture redox potential and subsequently established a threshold redox potential above which the mAb remained intact and below which there were significant and highly variable amounts of reduced mAb. Using this knowledge, we developed three control schemes to prevent mAb reduction in the bioreactor by controlling the cell culture redox potential via an online redox probe. These control methodologies functioned by increasing the concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO), copper (II) (Cu), or both DO and Cu to maintain the redox potential above the threshold value. Using these methods, we were able to demonstrate successful control of antibody reduction. Importantly, the redox control strategies did not significantly impact the cell growth, viability, mAb production, or product quality attributes including aggregates, C-terminal lysine, high mannose, deamidation, and glycation. Our results demonstrate that controlling the cell culture redox potential is a simple and effective method to prevent mAb reduction.

Cell culture process metabolomics together with multivariate data analysis tools opens new routes for bioprocess development and glycosylation prediction. Multivariate latent variable methods have become a popular and versatile toolset to analyze bioprocess data in industry and academia. This work spans such applications from the evaluation of the role of the standard process variables and metabolites to the metabolomics level, that is, to the extensive number metabolic compounds detectable in the extracellular and intracellular domains. Given the substantial effort currently required for the measurement of the latter groups, a tailored methodology is presented that is capable of providing valuable process insights as well as predicting the glycosylation profile based on only four experiments measured over 12 cell culture days. An important result of the work is the possibility to accurately predict many of the glycan variables based on the information of three experiments. An additional finding is that such predictive models can be generated from the more accessible process and extracellular information only, that is, without including the more experimentally cumbersome intracellular data. With regards to the incorporation of omics data in the standard process analytics framework in the future, this works provides a comprehensive data analysis pathway which can efficiently support numerous bioprocessing tasks.

Metabolomic and quality data for early and late passages of an antibody-producing industrial CHO cell line. In this article, we provide four data sets for an industrial Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line producing antibodies during a 14-day bioreactor run. This cell line was selected for further evaluation because of its significant titer loss as the cells were passaged over time. Four conditions that differed in cell bank ages were run for this dataset. Specifically, cells were passaged to passage 12, 21, 25, and 37 and then used in this experiment. Once the run commenced the following datasets were gathered: 1). Glycosylation data for each reactor 2). Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) data for the antibodies produced which allowed for the identification of high and low molecular weight species in the samples (N-Glycan and SEC data was taken on day 14 only). 3/4). Metabolites levels measured using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) for all reactors over the time course of days 1, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 14. We also provide a graph of the glutamine levels for cells of different ages as an example of the utility of the data. These metabolomics data provide relative amounts for 36 metabolites (NMR) and 109 metabolites (LC-MS) over the 14-day time course. These data were collected in connection with a co-submitted paper [1].

Transient ammonia stress on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells yield alterations to alanine metabolism and IgG glycosylation profiles. Ammonia concentrations typically increase during mammalian cell cultures, mainly due to glutamine and other amino acid consumption. An early ammonia stress indicator is a metabolic shift with respect to alanine. To determine the underlying mechanisms of this metabolic shift, a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line with two distinct ages (standard and young) was cultured in parallel fed-batch bioreactors with 0 mM or 10 mM ammonia added at 12 h. Reduced viable cell densities were observed for the stressed cells, while viability was not significantly affected. The stressed cultures had higher alanine, lactate, and glutamate accumulation. Interestingly, the ammonia concentrations were similar by Day 8.5 for all cultures. We hypothesized the ammonia was converted to alanine as a coping mechanism. Interestingly, no significant differences were observed for metabolite profiles due to cell age. Glycosylation analysis showed the ammonia stress reduced galactosylation, sialylation, and fucosylation. Transcriptome analysis of the standard-aged cultures indicated the ammonia stress had a limited impact on the transcriptome, where few of the significant changes were directly related metabolite or glycosylation reactions. These results indicate that mechanisms used to alleviate ammonia stress are most likely controlled post-transcriptionally, and this is where future research should focus.

Multi-omics profiling of a CHO cell culture system unravels the effect of culture pH on cell growth, antibody titer, and product quality. A robust monoclonal antibody (mAb) bioprocess requires physiological parameters such as temperature, pH, or dissolved oxygen to be well-controlled as even small variations in them could potentially impact the final product quality. For instance, pH substantially affects N-glycosylation, protein aggregation, and charge variant profiles, as well as mAb productivity. However, relatively less is known about how pH jointly influences product quality and titer. In this study, we investigated the effect of pH on culture performance, product titer, and quality profiles by applying longitudinal multi-omics profiling, including transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and glycomics, at three different culture pH set points. The subsequent systematic analysis of multi-omics data showed that pH set points differentially regulated various intracellular pathways including intracellular vesicular trafficking, cell cycle, and apoptosis, thereby resulting in differences in specific productivity, product titer, and quality profiles. In addition, a time-dependent variation in mAb N-glycosylation profiles, independent of pH, was identified to be mainly due to the accumulation of mAb proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum disrupting cellular homeostasis over culture time. Overall, this multi-omics-based study provides an in-depth understanding of the intracellular processes in mAb-producing CHO cell line under varied pH conditions, and could serve as a baseline for enabling the quality optimization and control of mAb production.

Continuous Feeding Reduces the Generation of Metabolic Byproducts and Increases Antibodies Expression in Chinese Hamster Ovary-K1 Cells. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the most important host system used for monoclonal antibody (mAb) expression. Moreover, the fed-batch culture mode is the most widely used method to increase mAb expression in CHO cells by increasing the amount of feed. However, a high amount of culture feed results in the production of metabolic byproducts. In this work, we used a continuous feeding strategy to reduce metabolic byproducts and improve mouse-human chimeric anti-epidermal growth factor receptor vIII (EGFRvIII) antibody C12 expression in Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells. Moreover, the effects of the feeding strategy on the cell culture and monoclonal antibody production were evaluated in chemically defined suspension cultures of recombinant CHO-K1 cells. Compared with bolus feeding methods, the continuous feeding method did not have any advantages when the feeding amount was low, but with a high feeding amount, the continuous feeding method significantly reduced the concentrations of lactate and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> in the later culture stage. At the end of the culture stage, compared with bolus feeding methods, the lactate and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> concentrations under the continuous feeding mode were reduced by approximately 45% and 80%, respectively. In addition, the antibody C12 expression level was also increased by almost 10%. Compared to the bolus feeding method, the antibody C12 produced by the continuous feeding method had a lower content of high-mannose glycoforms. Further analysis found that the osmolality of the continuous feeding method was lower than that of the typical fed-batch bolus feeding method. Conclusively, these results indicate that the continuous feeding method is very useful for reducing metabolic byproducts and achieving higher levels of mAb production.

Raman based chemometric model development for glycation and glycosylation real time monitoring in a manufacturing scale CHO cell bioreactor process. The Quality by Design (QbD) approach to the production of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) emphasizes an understanding of the production process ensuring product quality is maintained throughout. Current methods for measuring critical quality attributes (CQAs) such as glycation and glycosylation are time and resource intensive, often, only tested offline once per batch process. Process analytical technology (PAT) tools such as Raman spectroscopy combined with chemometric modeling can provide real time measurements process variables and are aligned with the QbD approach. This study utilizes these tools to build partial least squares (PLS) regression models to provide real time monitoring of glycation and glycosylation profiles. In total, seven cell line specific chemometric PLS models; % mono-glycated, % non-glycated, % G0F-GlcNac, % G0, % G0F, % G1F, and % G2F were considered. PLS models were initially developed using small scale data to verify the capability of Raman to measure these CQAs effectively. Accurate PLS model predictions were observed at small scale (5 L). At manufacturing scale (2000 L) some glycosylation models showed higher error, indicating that scale may be a key consideration in glycosylation profile PLS model development. Model robustness was then considered by supplementing models with a single batch of manufacturing scale data. This data addition had a significant impact on the predictive capability of each model, with an improvement of 77.5% in the case of the G2F. The finalized models show the capability of Raman as a PAT tool to deliver real time monitoring of glycation and glycosylation profiles at manufacturing scale.

Effects of pyruvate on primary metabolism and product quality for a high-density perfusion process. High volumetric productivities can be achieved when perfusion processes are operated at high cell densities. Yet it is fairly challenging to keep high cell density cultures in a steady state over an extended period. Aiming for robust processes, cultures were operated at a constant biomass specific perfusion rate (BSPR) in this study. The cell density was monitored with a capacitance probe and a continuous bleed maintained the targeted viable cell volume. Despite our tightly controlled BSPR, a gradual accumulation of ammonium and changes in cell diameter were observed during the production phase for three different monoclonal antibodies. Although a lot of efforts in media optimization have been made to reduce ammonium in fed-batch process, less examples are known about how media components impact the cellular metabolism and thus the quality of monoclonal antibodies in continuous processes. In this study, we show that a continuous Na-pyruvate feed (2 g/L/day) strongly reduced ammonium production and stabilized fucosylation, sialylation and high mannose content for three different mAbs.

Characterization of Monoclonal Antibody Glycan Heterogeneity Using Hydrophilic Interaction Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. Glycosylation is a critical quality attribute of monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutics. Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS) is an invaluable technology for the characterization of protein glycosylation. HILIC/MS-based glycan analysis relies on the library search using Glucose Units (GU) and accurate mass (AM) as the primary search parameters for identification. However, GU-based identifications are gradient-dependent and are not suitable for applications where separation gradients need to be optimized to analyze complex samples or achieve higher throughput. Additionally, the workflow requires calibration curves (using dextran ladder) to be generated for each analysis campaign, which in turn, are used to derive the GU values of the separated glycan species. To overcome this limitation, we employed a two-step strategy for targeted glycan analysis of a mAb expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. The first step is to create a custom library of the glycans of interest independent of GU values (thereby eliminating the need for a calibration curve) and instead uses AM and retention time (RT) as the primary search variables. The second step is to perform targeted glycan screening using the custom-built library. The developed workflow was applied for targeted glycan analysis of a mAb expressed in CHO for 1) cell line selection 2) characterizing the day-wise glycan evolution in a model mAb during a fed-batch culture, 3) assessing the impact of different media conditions on glycosylation, and 4) evaluating the impact of two different process conditions on glycosylation changes in a model mAb grown in a bioreactor. Taken together, the data presented in this study provides insights into the sources of glycan heterogeneity in a model mAb that are seen during its commercial manufacturing.

Development of a miniature bioreactor model to study the impact of pH and DOT fluctuations on CHO cell culture performance as a tool to understanding heterogeneity effects at large-scale. Understanding the impact of spatial heterogeneities that are known to occur in large-scale cell culture bioreactors remains a significant challenge. This work presents a novel methodology for mimicking the effects of pH and dissolved oxygen heterogeneities on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell culture performance and antibody quality characteristics, using an automated miniature bioreactor system. Cultures of 4 different cell lines, expressing 3 IgG molecules and one fusion protein, were exposed to repeated pH and dissolved oxygen tension (DOT) fluctuations between pH 7.0-7.5 and DOT 10%-30%, respectively, for durations of 15, 30, and 60 min. Fluctuations in pH had a minimal impact on growth, productivity, and product quality although some changes in lactate metabolism were observed. DOT fluctuations were found to have a more significant impact; a 35% decrease in cell growth and product titre was observed in the fastest growing cell line tested, while all cell lines exhibited a significant increase in lactate accumulation. Product quality analysis yielded varied results; two cell lines showed an increase in the G0F glycan and decrease in G1F, G2F, and Man5; however, another line showed the opposite trend. The study suggests that the response of CHO cells to the effects of fluctuating culture conditions is cell line specific and that higher growing cell lines are most impacted. The miniature bioreactor system described in this work therefore provides a platform for use during early stage cell culture process development to identify cell lines that may be adversely impacted by the pH and DOT heterogeneities encountered on scale-up. This experimental data can be combined with computational modeling approaches to predict overall cell culture performance in large-scale bioreactors.

Engineering death resistance in CHO cells for improved perfusion culture. The reliable and cost-efficient manufacturing of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is essential to fulfil their ever-growing demand. Cell death in bioreactors reduces productivity and product quality, and is largely attributed to apoptosis. In perfusion bioreactors, this leads to the necessity of a bleed stream, which negatively affects the overall process economy. To combat this limitation, death-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cell lines were developed by simultaneously knocking out the apoptosis effector proteins Bak1, Bax, and Bok with CRISPR technology. These cell lines were cultured in fed-batch and perfusion bioreactors and compared to an unmodified control cell line. In fed-batch, the death-resistant cell lines showed higher cell densities and longer culture durations, lasting nearly a month under standard culture conditions. In perfusion, the death-resistant cell lines showed slower drops in viability and displayed an arrest in cell division after which cell size increased instead. Pertinently, the death-resistant cell lines demonstrated the ability to be cultured for several weeks without bleed, and achieved similar volumetric productivities at lower cell densities than that of the control cell line. Perfusion culture reduced fragmentation of the mAb produced, and the death-resistant cell lines showed increased glycosylation in the light chain in both bioreactor modes. These data demonstrate that rationally engineered death-resistant cell lines are ideal for mAb production in perfusion culture, negating the need to bleed the bioreactor whilst maintaining product quantity and quality.

Enhancing and stabilizing monoclonal antibody production by Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with optimized perfusion culture strategies. The perfusion medium is critical in maintaining high cell concentration in cultures for the production of monoclonal antibody by Chinese hamster ovary cells. In this study, the effects of perfusion culture strategies when using different media on the process stability, product titer, and product quality were investigated in 3-L bioreactor. The results indicated that continuous perfusion could maintain higher levels of cell density, product titer, and quality in comparison with those of the intermittent perfusion culture. Next, the perfusion culture conditions with different perfusion rates and temperature reduction methods were further optimized. When combining the high perfusion rates and delayed reduction of culture temperature at day 6, the product titer reached a higher level of 16.19 g/L with the monomer relative abundant of 97.6%. In this case, the main peak of the product reached 56.3% and the total N-glycans ratio was 95.2%. To verify the effectiveness of the optimized perfusion culture in a larger scale, a 200-L bioreactor was used to perform and the final product titer reached the highest level of 16.79 g/L at day 16. Meanwhile, the product quality (monomer abundant of 97.6%, main peak of 56.3%, and N-glycans ratio of 96.5%) could also be well maintained. This study provided some guidance for the high-efficient production of monoclonal antibody by CHO cells <i>via</i> optimized perfusion culture strategy.

Optimization of medium with perfusion microbioreactors for high density CHO cell cultures at very low renewal rate aided by design of experiments. A novel approach of design of experiment (DoE) is developed for the optimization of key substrates of the culture medium, amino acids, and sugars, by utilizing perfusion microbioreactors with 2 mL working volume, operated in high cell density continuous mode, to explore the design space. A mixture DoE based on a simplex-centroid is proposed to test multiple medium blends in parallel perfusion runs, where the amino acids concentrations are selected based on the culture behavior in presence of different amino acid mixtures, and using targeted specific consumption rates. An optimized medium is identified with models predicting the culture parameters and product quality attributes (G0 and G1 level N-glycans) as a function of the medium composition. It is then validated in runs performed in perfusion microbioreactor in comparison with stirred-tank bioreactors equipped with alternating tangential flow filtration (ATF) or with tangential flow filtration (TFF) for cell separation, showing overall a similar process performance and N-glycosylation profile of the produced antibody. These results demonstrate that the present development strategy generates a perfusion medium with optimized performance for stable Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell cultures operated with very high cell densities of 60 × 10<sup>6</sup> and 120 × 10<sup>6</sup>  cells/mL and a low cell-specific perfusion rate of 17 pL/cell/day, which is among the lowest reported and is in line with the framework recently published by the industry.

Recombinant Human CD19 in CHO-K1 Cells: Glycosylation Patterns as a Quality Attribute of High Yield Processes. CD19 is an essential protein in personalized CD19-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell-based cancer immunotherapies and CAR-T cell functionality evaluation. However, the recombinant expression of this "difficult to-express" (DTE) protein is challenging, and therefore, commercial access to the protein is limited. We have previously described the successful stable expression of our soluble CD19-AD2 fusion protein of the CD19 extracellular part fused with human serum albumin domain 2 (AD2) in CHO-K1 cells. The function, stability, and secretion rate of DTE proteins can be improved by culture conditions, such as reduced temperature and a shorter residence time. Moreover, glycosylation, as one of the most important post-translational modifications, represents a critical quality attribute potentially affecting CAR-T cell effector function and thus impacting therapy's success. In this study, we increased the production rate of CD19-AD2 by 3.5-fold through applying hypothermic culture conditions. We efficiently improved the purification of our his-tagged CD19-AD2 fusion protein via a Ni-NTA-based affinity column using a stepwise increase in the imidazole concentration. The binding affinity to commercially available anti-CD19 antibodies was evaluated via Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI). Furthermore, we revealed glycosylation patterns via Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS), and five highly sialylated and multi-antennary N-glycosylation sites were identified. In summary, we optimized the CD19-AD2 production and purification process and were the first to characterize five highly complex N-glycosylation sites.

Sodium chloride impacts glycosylation and N- and O-glycan site occupancy of an Fc-fusion protein. Fc-fusion proteins are highly complex molecules, difficult to manufacture at scale. In this work, undesired proteoforms were detected during the manufacture of a therapeutic fusion protein produced in CHO cells. These species were characterized using gel electrophoresis, size exclusion chromatography and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry leading to the identification of low molecular weight proteoforms presenting low N- and O-glycan site occupancy, as well as a low sialylation content. Upstream process parameters were investigated, and fusion protein quality was shown to be linked to the sodium chloride content of the medium. A mitigation strategy was developed to avoid formation of unwanted glyco-variants, resulting in an increased yield of highly glycosylated Fc-fusion protein. The effect of sodium chloride was shown to be independent of the osmolality increase and was hypothesized to be linked to a modulation of Golgi acidity, which is required for the correct localization and function of glycosyltransferases. Altogether, this study highlights the importance of the salt balance in cell culture media used to produce highly sialylated and occupied glycoproteins, helping to maximize the yield and increase robustness of processes aiming at producing biopharmaceutical complex therapeutic molecules.
