Characterization of Monoclonal Antibody Glycan Heterogeneity Using Hydrophilic Interaction Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. Glycosylation is a critical quality attribute of monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutics. Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS) is an invaluable technology for the characterization of protein glycosylation. HILIC/MS-based glycan analysis relies on the library search using Glucose Units (GU) and accurate mass (AM) as the primary search parameters for identification. However, GU-based identifications are gradient-dependent and are not suitable for applications where separation gradients need to be optimized to analyze complex samples or achieve higher throughput. Additionally, the workflow requires calibration curves (using dextran ladder) to be generated for each analysis campaign, which in turn, are used to derive the GU values of the separated glycan species. To overcome this limitation, we employed a two-step strategy for targeted glycan analysis of a mAb expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. The first step is to create a custom library of the glycans of interest independent of GU values (thereby eliminating the need for a calibration curve) and instead uses AM and retention time (RT) as the primary search variables. The second step is to perform targeted glycan screening using the custom-built library. The developed workflow was applied for targeted glycan analysis of a mAb expressed in CHO for 1) cell line selection 2) characterizing the day-wise glycan evolution in a model mAb during a fed-batch culture, 3) assessing the impact of different media conditions on glycosylation, and 4) evaluating the impact of two different process conditions on glycosylation changes in a model mAb grown in a bioreactor. Taken together, the data presented in this study provides insights into the sources of glycan heterogeneity in a model mAb that are seen during its commercial manufacturing.
