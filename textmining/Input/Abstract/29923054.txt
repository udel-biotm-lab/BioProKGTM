Ultra-low carbon dioxide partial pressure improves the galactosylation of a monoclonal antibody produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells in a bioreactor. To explore the influence of ultra-low carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO<sub>2</sub>) on the monoclonal antibody (mAb) N-glycosylation profile in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell culture.
