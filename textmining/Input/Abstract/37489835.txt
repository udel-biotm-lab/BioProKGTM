Sodium chloride impacts glycosylation and N- and O-glycan site occupancy of an Fc-fusion protein. Fc-fusion proteins are highly complex molecules, difficult to manufacture at scale. In this work, undesired proteoforms were detected during the manufacture of a therapeutic fusion protein produced in CHO cells. These species were characterized using gel electrophoresis, size exclusion chromatography and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry leading to the identification of low molecular weight proteoforms presenting low N- and O-glycan site occupancy, as well as a low sialylation content. Upstream process parameters were investigated, and fusion protein quality was shown to be linked to the sodium chloride content of the medium. A mitigation strategy was developed to avoid formation of unwanted glyco-variants, resulting in an increased yield of highly glycosylated Fc-fusion protein. The effect of sodium chloride was shown to be independent of the osmolality increase and was hypothesized to be linked to a modulation of Golgi acidity, which is required for the correct localization and function of glycosyltransferases. Altogether, this study highlights the importance of the salt balance in cell culture media used to produce highly sialylated and occupied glycoproteins, helping to maximize the yield and increase robustness of processes aiming at producing biopharmaceutical complex therapeutic molecules.
