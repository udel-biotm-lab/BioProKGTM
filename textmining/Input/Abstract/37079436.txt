Optimization of medium with perfusion microbioreactors for high density CHO cell cultures at very low renewal rate aided by design of experiments. A novel approach of design of experiment (DoE) is developed for the optimization of key substrates of the culture medium, amino acids, and sugars, by utilizing perfusion microbioreactors with 2 mL working volume, operated in high cell density continuous mode, to explore the design space. A mixture DoE based on a simplex-centroid is proposed to test multiple medium blends in parallel perfusion runs, where the amino acids concentrations are selected based on the culture behavior in presence of different amino acid mixtures, and using targeted specific consumption rates. An optimized medium is identified with models predicting the culture parameters and product quality attributes (G0 and G1 level N-glycans) as a function of the medium composition. It is then validated in runs performed in perfusion microbioreactor in comparison with stirred-tank bioreactors equipped with alternating tangential flow filtration (ATF) or with tangential flow filtration (TFF) for cell separation, showing overall a similar process performance and N-glycosylation profile of the produced antibody. These results demonstrate that the present development strategy generates a perfusion medium with optimized performance for stable Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell cultures operated with very high cell densities of 60 × 10<sup>6</sup> and 120 × 10<sup>6</sup>  cells/mL and a low cell-specific perfusion rate of 17 pL/cell/day, which is among the lowest reported and is in line with the framework recently published by the industry.
